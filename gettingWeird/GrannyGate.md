GrannyGate: A Tale of Fraudulent Science and Pandemic Gaslighting

Introduction:
For decades, a dual tragedy played out in science and medicine, ensnaring society’s most vulnerable—our “grandmas.” On one front, Alzheimer’s disease research was built on a potentially fraudulent foundation: manipulated data propping up the dominant amyloid hypothesis. On another, the COVID-19 pandemic response wove a narrative around mRNA vaccines that brooked no dissent, even as cracks in the story appeared. In both sagas, powerful institutions silenced and gaslit critics, casting truth-tellers as pariahs (even “grandma killers”) while claiming to protect the public. This exposé, aptly dubbed “GrannyGate,” unifies these timelines of deceit. Using the GASLIT-AF framework (an acronym we use to describe Gatekeeping, Authority-abuse, Silencing, Labeling, Institutional Trickery – Against Fact-finders), we chart how courageous dissenters were systematically marginalized—only to be vindicated years later. We will follow the chronology from the 1990s to 2025, mapping key events and actors, and highlighting how institutional inversion (when authorities accuse others of the very misconduct they perpetrate), media manipulation, and outright fraud compromised the truth. The story that emerges is mythic in scope: a modern David-vs-Goliath, in which those derided as conspiracy theorists were, in fact, trying to save lives and protect our grandmas all along.

Origins of a Hypothesis and a Pandora’s Box (1990s–2000s)

Alzheimer’s Research – The Amyloid Orthodoxy: In the 1990s, Dr. John Hardy and colleagues at University College London cemented what became the ruling dogma of Alzheimer’s disease: the amyloid-beta hypothesis. This theory posited that sticky amyloid-beta plaques in the brain are the primary cause of Alzheimer’s. Hardy’s influential 1992 paper on familial Alzheimer’s genetic mutations gave the hypothesis a compelling foundation, and it soon achieved dominance in the field ￼. Over the next three decades, Hardy and like-minded researchers formed what critics wryly termed the “amyloid mafia” ￼ – a clique of powerful labs, grant committees, and journal gatekeepers singularly focused on amyloid. Dissenting voices who suggested alternative causes (such as tau proteins, inflammation, or other mechanisms) often found themselves sidelined. As one investigative report later noted, Hardy’s group was so dominant that for years their theory went virtually unchallenged ￼. This hegemony came at a cost: by 2020, billions of dollars had poured into amyloid-centered research and drug trials, yet no cure or truly effective treatment for Alzheimer’s had emerged. The amyloid hypothesis had become a scientific orthodoxy, resistant to criticism – even as troubling signs of possible fraud in its supporting research began to surface.

Manipulation beneath the Surface: Unbeknownst to the public, some of the seminal studies underpinning the amyloid theory were built on shaky ground. Image manipulation and data fabrication crept into Alzheimer’s research as early as the 2000s. A Nature paper in 2006 (a cornerstone study linking amyloid plaques to memory loss in mice) would much later come under scrutiny for doctored images. But at the time, such results only strengthened the amyloid cabal’s influence. Top journals eagerly published amyloid-focused papers, and the NIH’s National Institute on Aging (NIA) – with an annual budget in the billions – funneled grants to amyloid projects almost exclusively. By the late 2000s, an entire generation of Alzheimer’s researchers either joined the amyloid bandwagon or saw their own proposals starve for funding. In retrospect, this period planted the seeds of a crisis: a monoculture in research where challenging data were ignored or suppressed. Scientists who questioned amyloid’s primacy – warning that we might be on the wrong track – were treated as heretics. They faced difficulty publishing, scant funding, and even personal attacks. The institutional gatekeeping was so severe that it recalls a “church of amyloid,” enforcing its dogma and deflecting all dissent. (Indeed, some years later, internal emails would show Dr. Hardy chastising a critic for “causing harm” by questioning amyloid – an Orwellian inversion of reality considering the real harm was a failed research paradigm.) The stage was set for a massive correction once the truth came to light.

Viral Research – The Rise of Gain-of-Function: Meanwhile, another Pandora’s box was being opened in virology. In the 2000s, scientists began experimenting with gain-of-function (GOF) research on pathogens – deliberately enhancing viruses in the lab to study potential pandemic threats. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, labs in the U.S. and abroad took an keen interest in coronaviruses. By the early 2010s, researchers (notably in the U.S. and China) were creating novel chimeric coronaviruses, splicing genes to increase infectivity in human cells. Proponents argued this would help predict and prevent pandemics; critics warned it was a recipe for disaster should a lab accident occur. In 2011, alarm bells rang when two teams famously made an airborne-transmissible H5N1 avian flu, sparking international debate over scientific ethics. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), and specifically Dr. Anthony Fauci’s NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), emerged as key funders and defenders of GOF research. Despite the controversy – and a U.S. federal moratorium on certain GOF projects in 2014 – research continued by exploiting loopholes and offshore collaborations. Fauci was a vocal advocate, downplaying the risks even as other experts, like molecular biologist Richard Ebright, cautioned that an engineered pathogen could escape and cause a pandemic. This split in the scientific community mirrored the amyloid wars in spirit: a powerful establishment vs. a concerned minority. Little did anyone know how fateful these GOF experiments would become by the end of the decade. The ground was laid for the COVID-19 origin debate – a debate that authorities would later try desperately to control.

Warnings Ignored and Gates Closing (2010s)

Entrenchment of the Amyloid Mafia: By the 2010s, the amyloid-centric establishment in Alzheimer’s research had only tightened its grip. Dr. John Hardy’s influence was pervasive: he sat on editorial boards and advisory panels, helping decide which projects got published and funded. Alternative hypotheses – for example, theories focusing on tau protein tangles, vascular factors, or lifestyle causes – got relatively scant attention. The result was a systemic marginalization of dissenting ideas. Whispers of trouble did emerge from within the amyloid camp itself: repeated failures of amyloid-targeting drugs in clinical trials prompted some to question whether removing amyloid plaques was truly helping patients. Dozens of amyloid-clearing drug candidates faltered in Phase III trials, each disappointment met with excuses (perhaps the drug was given too late in disease, or dosage was insufficient) rather than a re-examination of the core hypothesis. A few veteran neuroscientists began to openly criticize the “amyloid-only” mindset. For instance, Dr. George Perry at UT San Antonio and others pointed out that amyloid plaques often correlate poorly with dementia severity, suggesting amyloid might be a byproduct rather than the primary cause. Yet such critics were ostracized. Hardy and colleagues frequently responded by admonishing them for “harming the field” or undermining hope. This gaslighting of skeptics kept rank-and-file researchers in line – junior scientists knew that open criticism of amyloid was a career risk. The amyloid mafia’s institutional power was near-total: as later documented, thousands of published papers reinforced each other in a closed loop, many of them built on manipulated or irreproducible data ￼ ￼. The foundation was rotten, but it remained invisible under layers of citation and prestige.

Early Whispers of Fraud: Behind closed doors, some journal editors and NIH officials were becoming aware of potential research misconduct in the Alzheimer’s literature. Rumors circulated that certain images in high-profile papers looked oddly perfect – perhaps too perfect. In one case, Western blot bands (a type of lab image) appeared duplicated or Photoshopped. By the late 2010s, anonymous whistleblowers and sleuths (sometimes on internet forums) had begun scrutinizing published figures, noting anomalies in papers that were central to the amyloid hypothesis. Still, no formal action was taken for years. The scientific establishment was loath to upend the Alzheimer’s apple cart; too much was at stake. The NIH’s NIA kept funding the same labs, and pharmaceutical companies kept investing in amyloid drug trials (lured by the prospect of a blockbuster cure if the hypothesis paid off). In essence, the system doubled down. The institutional inversion at play was stark: rather than rewarding those who sought the truth, the system rewarded those who produced confirmatory results – even if it meant turning a blind eye to fraud. A mythopoetic lens might describe this as the hubris before the fall: like Icarus flying too close to the sun, the amyloid establishment flew high on decades of unquestioned belief, not realizing the wax holding their wings (the integrity of their data) was melting.

GOF Research Escalates – Warnings Unheeded: In parallel, the 2010s saw gain-of-function virology research escalate, notably with coronaviruses. In 2015, a team from the U.S. and China (including Dr. Ralph Baric at UNC and Dr. Shi Zhengli at the Wuhan Institute of Virology) published a landmark experiment creating a novel coronavirus by combining a SARS-like bat virus with a human-adapted backbone. The chimeric virus was able to infect human airway cells – proof that making a more dangerous virus in the lab was quite feasible. This study, funded by NIH grants, set off alarm bells for some. In 2016–2017, internal NIH discussions considered whether certain experiments should undergo extra review under the new P3CO framework (guidelines for Pandemic Potential Pathogen Care and Oversight) when the 2014 moratorium was lifted. Yet records later showed that NIAID officials downplayed the risks and often exempted projects from additional oversight by narrowly defining what counted as “gain-of-function.” By the late 2010s, EcoHealth Alliance (led by Dr. Peter Daszak) – an NIH-funded nonprofit – was channeling U.S. funds to the Wuhan Institute for advanced coronavirus research. A few experts (and at least one U.S. embassy cable from Beijing in 2018) warned of lax safety at the Wuhan lab and the dangers of the novel experiments ￼. These warnings, however, were kept out of the limelight. Instead of a broad scientific debate about GOF, an elite circle of virologists and health officials controlled the narrative, insisting that the research was essential and dismissing critics as alarmists. Much like the amyloid saga, a set of insiders held the levers of funding and publication, ensuring a “single narrative” dominated within the expert community.

Crisis and Lockstep Narratives (2019–2020)

The Alzheimer’s Cover Cracks: In 2019 and 2020, the first seismic jolt hit Alzheimer’s research. A young neuroscientist working on dementia tipped off a journalist that something was very wrong in the literature ￼. This tip eventually made its way to Charles Piller, an investigative reporter for Science magazine. By late 2020, Piller was quietly digging into allegations that fraudulent data lay at the heart of the dominant Alzheimer’s hypothesis ￼. Particularly, suspicion centered on that famous 2006 Nature study, which had reported a unique form of amyloid-beta (called Aβ*56) as a memory-robbing toxin. If that study was bogus, an entire sub-field could come crashing down. Meanwhile, in June 2021 (just as these investigations were heating up behind the scenes), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made a controversial decision that underscored how entrenched the amyloid belief had become: the FDA approved Aducanumab (brand name Aduhelm), the first new Alzheimer’s drug in decades, despite an advisory committee’s near-unanimous objection due to lack of evidence of clinical benefit. The approval was based on Aducanumab’s ability to clear amyloid plaques, not on clear cognitive improvements in patients – a triumph of the amyloid theory over ambiguous data. Three committee members resigned in protest. Yet the amyloid mafia celebrated the decision as vindication. This moment exemplified institutional inversion: regulators and companies insisted they were helping patients (grandmothers with Alzheimer’s) by betting on amyloid, while independent experts shouted that the data didn’t support it, to no avail. The FDA’s move, arguably driven by public pressure and industry lobbying, further marginalized dissenting scientists. In essence, the official narrative held: amyloid must be the key, and to question that – even as fraud allegations brewed – was portrayed as undermining hope for a cure.

The COVID-19 Pandemic Erupts: In late 2019, the world was blindsided by the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China. By early 2020, COVID-19 had spread globally, threatening millions of (mostly elderly) lives. In these chaotic early days, two critical questions arose: Where did this virus come from? and How do we stop it? The official answers crystallized quickly – perhaps too quickly. Chinese authorities pointed to a wild animal market, suggesting a natural zoonotic spillover. This was bolstered by a group of Western scientists who, in February 2020, published a now-infamous letter in The Lancet condemning “conspiracy theories suggesting COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.” Not disclosed in that letter was that its organizer, Peter Daszak, had a conflict of interest (his EcoHealth Alliance funded Wuhan’s coronavirus work). Similarly, in March 2020, leading virologists – some of whom privately suspected a lab origin – published the “Proximal Origin” paper in Nature Medicine, emphatically concluding an lab leak was highly unlikely. Behind the scenes, top NIH officials were orchestrating this narrative. Emails later released (via congressional inquiries) showed that Dr. Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins were involved in prompting these efforts. They “wanted a single narrative” on the virus’s origin ￼, as former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield testified. Redfield, who suspected a lab leak early on, was excluded from internal discussions by Fauci and Collins in February 2020 ￼ ￼. According to Redfield, he was told his input was not welcome because it differed from the desired story ￼. This was a striking example of gaslighting in real time: a highly credentialed scientist (the head of the CDC) was painted as an outsider for raising a valid scientific hypothesis. Instead of investigating the lab-leak possibility, the establishment moved to smear it as a conspiracy theory ￼ – in part to protect the institutions (NIH/NIAID) that had funded risky research at Wuhan ￼. Thus, very early in the pandemic, a false consensus was manufactured: COVID-19 was natural and to say otherwise was to undermine the scientific and public health response.

“Safe and Effective” – The Vaccine Narrative Takes Hold: By mid-2020, attention shifted to vaccines as the exit strategy from the pandemic. A novel mRNA vaccine platform (developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech in partnership with NIAID) moved at lightning speed. In late 2020, clinical trial results were announced with great fanfare: the vaccines were reported to have “95% efficacy” in preventing COVID illness. This figure (a relative risk reduction) was trumpeted by press releases and media headlines, understandably raising public hopes. When the vaccines rolled out in early 2021, public health leaders conveyed a simple message: these vaccines are extremely safe and will protect you and others from COVID. Any nuance – such as the distinction between preventing infection vs. preventing severe disease, or the lack of long-term safety data – was largely drowned out. Health officials like Dr. Fauci and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky initially even suggested that vaccinated people wouldn’t spread the virus. At the same time, governments around the world began to consider or implement mandates, especially to “protect grandma” and other vulnerable people. The implication was that refusing vaccination (or even expressing hesitancy) was irresponsible and dangerous to others. Indeed, in the media and public discourse, an aggressive moral narrative emerged: those questioning the vaccines were selfish “anti-vaxxers” at best, and at worst tantamount to murderers – “grandma killers.” While that exact phrasing was a colloquial social media insult, the sentiment was reflected in mainstream commentary. For example, commentators argued that those unwilling to mask or vaccinate were literally endangering the lives of the elderly. This created a climate of intense social pressure and narrowed the space for open discussion. Simultaneously, Big Tech companies took an unprecedented role in shaping the narrative. In April 2020, as Facebook instituted special COVID “misinformation” policies, CEO Mark Zuckerberg privately coordinated with Fauci about messaging. Facebook and other platforms removed or down-ranked content that deviated from official guidelines. By early 2021, any post that raised concerns about vaccine safety or efficacy – no matter how mild or evidence-based – risked removal or “fact-check” flags ￼ ￼. The public was told to “trust the science,” but only a particular version of “science” was allowed. Under this regime, dissenting experts were deplatformed, and whistleblowers silenced, all in the name of protecting public health.

High Stakes and Hard Lines (2021)

Silencing the Skeptics – Gaslighting in Real Time: The year 2021 saw the height of what can only be described as institutional gaslighting on both fronts of GrannyGate. In Alzheimer’s research, even as investigative journalists were uncovering fraud, the old guard struck back. An illustrative moment came in April 2025 (later revealed publicly) when John Hardy emailed one of his vocal critics, Dr. George Perry. In that email, Hardy admonished Perry: “Sometimes you have to know when to say you were wrong… It is time to fold because now you are doing harm.”. The irony is blistering. Hardy was effectively telling a truth-seeker to shut up for the good of the field, accusing him of causing harm by exposing falsehoods. This is gaslighting defined – manipulating someone into questioning their own stance by portraying them as the villain. At the time (2021–22), Perry and a few others were raising alarms about the integrity of amyloid research, noting the rash of image manipulations being uncovered. Rather than welcome this critical self-examination, leaders of the field cast the whistleblowers as dangerous. The amyloid mafia closed ranks, issuing public statements that any fraud was limited and didn’t invalidate the overall theory. This is reminiscent of a mythic institutional self-defense, akin to an ancient priesthood protecting its deity; here the “deity” was the amyloid hypothesis, and heretics were to be excommunicated. But the walls were closing in on this decades-long deception – a reckoning loomed as data audits gained steam in labs worldwide.

Censorship as Policy – The COVID Information Clampdown: On the COVID/vaccine side, 2021 was the year when official narratives were enforced with unprecedented fervor. Social media companies, under pressure from governments and guided by NGOs like the “Trusted News Initiative,” established digital dragnet systems to catch and suppress alleged misinformation. Facebook proudly announced it had removed over 16 million pieces of content and flagged 167 million COVID-related posts by mid-2021 ￼. Their own data showed that once a post was flagged, users almost never viewed the original content ￼ – a chillingly effective throttling of information. Some of this content was indeed outlandish conspiracy theory. But a great deal was legitimate debate or new evidence that simply ran counter to prevailing claims. For example, in November 2021, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) – one of the world’s oldest medical journals – published a whistleblower investigation by journalist Paul Thacker. The report exposed data integrity problems in Pfizer’s pivotal vaccine trial: at several trial sites run by a contractor (Ventavia Research Group), a whistleblower witnessed falsified data, broken blinding protocols, poorly trained staff, and slow follow-up on adverse events ￼. She reported these problems to the FDA in 2020 and was subsequently fired the same day ￼. This should have been major news and a cause for concern, prompting FDA audits. Instead, when BMJ went public with the story in 2021, it was immediately met with censorship on Facebook – flagged as “missing context.” One fact-checking outfit (Lead Stories) even published a rebuttal of sorts, not disproving any of BMJ’s facts but arguing that the implications were being misinterpreted. The fact-check’s message: yes, there were some issues, but that doesn’t “disqualify” the vaccine, and besides, “the benefits of the Pfizer vaccine far outweigh rare side effects” ￼. In essence, rather than investigate the problem, the response was to minimize it and attack the messenger, lest the public lose confidence. BMJ’s editors were outraged; they penned open letters criticizing Facebook’s heavy-handedness and “guilt by association” tactics (the fact-check had even noted the whistleblower’s Twitter account had anti-vax followers, as if that nullified her evidence) ￼. But their pleas fell largely on deaf ears in 2021. In that charged atmosphere, eminent scientists who spoke up about any vaccine drawbacks were similarly dismissed or punished. When Dr. Robert Malone (a scientist who had worked on mRNA technology) voiced concerns about vaccine safety on podcasts, he was swiftly banned from Twitter. When younger researchers pointed out that mRNA vaccines were linked to myocarditis in young males, health officials eventually acknowledged it but continued to push universal vaccination with minimal nuance. Public discussion on how to best protect seniors (who clearly benefitted most from vaccines) while perhaps tailoring strategies for others was stifled. Instead, the mantra was one-size-fits-all, and any deviation invited accusations of being “anti-science” or not caring if grandmothers died. This was the darkest embodiment of the Gaslit-AF model: authorities insisting that their narrative was the only truth and that those who questioned it were morally deficient.

Parallel Worlds of Deception: As 2021 drew to a close, the parallels between the Alzheimer’s and COVID stories became uncanny. In both domains, image was valued over reality. Alzheimer’s researchers literally relied on doctored images to support a mythic theory of amyloid, while public health officials carefully curated an image of vaccines as flawless silver bullets. In both cases, whistleblowers were ostracized. And in both, the purported beneficiaries – patients and the public – were in some ways left in the lurch. Alzheimer’s patients saw yet another drug (Aduhelm) with high costs and risks approved on a slim premise, while perhaps more promising avenues of research remained underfunded. The general public, particularly the elderly, were given a single solution (vaccinate and comply) without being informed of other layers of protection (like ventilation, therapeutics, or the protective effect of overcoming misinformation through transparent debate). The media’s role in these narratives was significant. In Alzheimer’s, science journalists for years had uncritically echoed the amyloid dogma, painting dissenters as fringe. In the pandemic, mainstream media often amplified the most alarmist and absolutist voices, lending support to censorship efforts. Retrospectively, it is evident that both sets of authorities – the “amyloid mafia” and the pandemic response leadership – believed they were acting in the public’s best interest. However, in their zeal and arrogance, they trampled scientific discourse and transparency, the very mechanisms that correct errors. This hubris would eventually unravel, but not before tremendous collateral damage.

Revelations and Vindication (2022–2025)

Alzheimer’s Reckoning – Fraud Exposed: The house of cards built by the amyloid mafia began to topple in 2022. Charles Piller’s investigative report hit Science in July 2022, revealing that images in the 2006 Nature paper and dozens of other Alzheimer’s studies appeared to be fabricated or manipulated ￼. The implications were staggering. Piller and other sleuths identified more than 100 papers with suspect data, many from prominent labs. Subsequent inquiries led journals to retract or flag a number of these studies. It turned out that at least 6 major Alzheimer’s researchers had published papers with evidence of manipulated data ￼. Although Dr. Sylvain Lesné (first author of the 2006 Nature study) was the focus of the initial scandal, the rot was more widespread. A February 2025 book by Charles Piller, Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer’s, catalogued the saga in painful detail ￼. One analysis noted that a whopping 77,000+ Alzheimer’s publications had cited the compromised papers ￼, meaning untold research efforts (and dollars) were spent following false leads. Even John Hardy – the godfather of the amyloid hypothesis – wasn’t unscathed: none of his own papers were proven fraudulent, but he had unknowingly cited tainted studies 58 times in his publications ￼. The “amyloid mafia,” it turned out, had built their empire on pillars of sand. Importantly, dissenting scientists were vindicated. The likes of George Perry, who had long doubted amyloid supremacy, were proven prescient in retrospect. As one mental health news outlet summarized in 2025, “evidence has emerged that research fraud on a massive scale… ensured that the vast majority of clinical research funding in Alzheimer’s went in [one] flawed direction.” ￼. At last, the field was forced to reckon with the question: If removing amyloid does not cure Alzheimer’s (as demonstrated by multiple drug failures) and key amyloid studies were fraudulent, perhaps the entire paradigm needs revision. This realization is bitter medicine – it means acknowledging that decades and billions may have been misdirected. By 2025, congressional interest was piqued: how did NIH’s oversight fail to catch this? After all, the NIH had not been merely a passive funder; one of its own, Dr. Eliezer Masliah (who headed neuroscience at NIA), was found to have falsified images in his past academic research ￼. He quietly resigned in 2024 when confronted ￼. The scandal reached the highest levels, suggesting a systemic problem. Hearings and inquiries into NIH’s grant oversight and the culture of academic science have been hinted. The amyloid era isn’t over overnight – many still defend aspects of the hypothesis – but the spell has been broken. Crucially, those who were gaslit for years feel a sense of righteous vindication: their “harmful skepticism” turned out to be the lantern that finally illuminated the truth.

COVID Origin – From Conspiracy to Consensus: In the domain of COVID-19, a similar shift occurred. What was branded a wild conspiracy in 2020 – the possibility of a lab leak origin – gained substantial credibility by 2023. Investigations by U.S. government agencies produced divided opinions (the Department of Energy and FBI leaned towards a lab origin with moderate confidence, while others were undecided). But it was congressional investigations, freed from one-party narrative control, that brought new evidence to light. In early 2023, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic held hearings where molecular biologists and former officials testified. Dr. Redfield’s bombshell testimony described how Fauci and Collins sidelined him and controlled the narrative in 2020 ￼ ￼. Emails obtained by the committee showed a February 1, 2020 teleconference among NIH-funded virologists; some participants initially thought the virus looked engineered, but days later they published papers calling a lab origin unlikely. The appearance of a cover-up was palpable. By mid-2023, even mainstream media acknowledged that lab leak was a plausible, perhaps even likely, explanation – something that would have gotten one banned from social media just a year prior. The term “conspiracy theorist” gradually faded from this discussion. In effect, the Overton window shifted: one could talk about lab accidents, NIH’s role in funding EcoHealth/WIV, and Daszak’s Lancet conflict without being shunned. This represented a major vindication for many independent researchers and internet sleuths who had been digging into this since 2020. They had been derided as cranks, yet their work uncovered, for instance, that EcoHealth’s NIH grant proposals included plans to insert novel cleavage sites into coronaviruses (a detail eerily similar to SARS-CoV-2’s unique feature). The gaslighting that occurred – where officials insisted “there is no evidence of a lab leak” and equated discussing it with peddling a hoax – is now widely seen as an overreach, if not an outright deception. As one Politico article put it, Fauci appeared to have pushed a single narrative to “divert attention” from U.S.-sponsored research in Wuhan ￼. Whether that was the intent or not, that was certainly the effect. The curtain has been pulled back on that episode of GrannyGate: far from being crackpots, those who challenged the official origin story were asking legitimate questions essential to preventing future pandemics.

Vaccine Narrative Admits Complexity: On the vaccine front, the years 2022–2025 forced public health officials to walk back some of the most absolutist claims. As data accumulated, it became undeniable that the mRNA vaccines, while remarkably effective at preventing severe illness and initial strains of the virus, did not stop transmission (especially after the virus evolved into new variants). “Breakthrough” infections in fully vaccinated individuals became common by late 2021, which directly undercut the argument that only the unvaccinated spread COVID. The rationale behind mandates shifted (to preventing hospital overload rather than achieving herd immunity), but by then the credibility of public messaging had taken a hit. More concerning, evidence of rare but significant vaccine side effects mounted. Young men faced a non-negligible risk of myocarditis (heart inflammation) post mRNA vaccine – a fact acknowledged officially by mid-2021. By 2022, studies also examined other adverse events. A notable peer-reviewed study in Vaccine (led by Joseph Fraiman et al.) re-analyzed the original Pfizer and Moderna trial data and found an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest on the order of 1 in 800 vaccinated ￼. This included severe conditions (some cardiovascular, some neurological). That finding challenged the earlier mantra that serious side effects were “one in a million.” It suggested the risk, while still low, was higher than public health officials had conveyed. In parallel, real-world pharmacovigilance picked up signals: for example, slightly elevated Guillain-Barré syndrome (a neurological disorder) cases after vaccination in some monitoring systems, and rare clotting disorders. Countries like Denmark and Norway adjusted their recommendations, advising against Moderna’s vaccine for young people due to myocarditis risk. In the U.S., Florida’s Surgeon General publicly recommended against mRNA vaccines for young men in late 2022, citing an analysis of cardiac complications – a move that was pilloried by federal agencies at the time but indicative of the evolving debate. By 2023, it became more acceptable to discuss these nuances: that the vaccines had crucial benefits for older adults and vulnerable populations, but a blanket approach for all ages could be re-examined. In other words, the conversation dissenters had tried to have in 2021 (and were shouted down for) finally began happening in the mainstream. Even tech platforms quietly rolled back some of their censorship policies as the “misinformation” of yesterday became the well-founded caution of today. Perhaps most telling, the phrase “safe and effective” gave way to a more measured tone in public service announcements, often acknowledging “potential risks” while emphasizing benefits. While there has not been an official admission of error, the shifts in policy and tone speak volumes. One might say the gaslit have been vindicated, albeit without apology. Those who were accused of “spreading vaccine hesitancy” for urging caution ended up prompting studies that confirmed some of their concerns. They too were, in a sense, trying to protect grandmas – not by rejecting vaccines wholesale, but by insisting on honesty about limitations and side effects so that public trust would not be squandered.

Figure: Influence network in the Alzheimer’s “amyloid mafia.” This schematic illustrates how a tightly-knit group of influential scientists, fueled by NIH funding and pharma interest, enforced the amyloid hypothesis as unquestionable dogma for years. They occupied key positions in journals and peer review, ensuring that manipulated data supporting amyloid pathology was widely published and cited, bolstering the hypothesis ￼. Meanwhile, they marginalized dissenting scientists who pursued alternate theories or pointed out flaws, accusing them of “doing harm” to patients’ hopes. Only after independent investigations exposed the fraudulent data did the truth begin to emerge, vindicating those dissenters. The actor-network here underscores institutional inversion: those claiming to protect patients were in fact perpetuating a costly error, whereas the “troublemakers” were the ones ultimately defending patients’ interests by seeking the real causes of Alzheimer’s. (Source: investigative findings by Science/Charles Piller and others ￼ ￼.)

Figure: Network of actors and narratives in the COVID-19 response “gaslighting.” This diagram maps the relationships between key institutions and narratives during the pandemic. NIH/NIAID leadership (Dr. Fauci & Dr. Collins) not only funded risky gain-of-function research in Wuhan ￼, but also enforced the official narrative that COVID-19 had a natural origin, effectively labeling the lab-leak hypothesis as misinformation to deflect blame ￼. Public health authorities and pharmaceutical companies together promoted the mRNA vaccines as a singular solution (“safe & effective”), yielding immense public uptake and pharma profits. However, whistleblowers and dissenting experts who raised concerns – whether about the virus’s origin or vaccine safety – were met with media and Big Tech censorship. They were deplatformed and smeared as spreaders of “misinformation” or lacking compassion ￼ ￼. The general public, especially the elderly, were the purported beneficiaries of the orthodox narrative, but they also stood to suffer if that narrative had blind spots. In hindsight, some of those labeled as “conspiracy theorists” or uncaring were actually advocating for investigations and caution that would have protected society (including grandmothers). The network highlights how institutional self-interest (funding, reputation) and fear of public panic combined to produce a tightly controlled message, at the expense of transparency.

Discussion: Gaslighting, Institutional Inversion, and Media Manipulation

Across both strands of GrannyGate, a consistent playbook – what we dub “GASLIT-AF” – emerges. The core tactics include:
	•	Gatekeeping & Authority Abuse (G): A small in-group of “experts” holds disproportionate power over funding, publications, and public messaging. In Alzheimer’s, this was the amyloid mafia controlling journals and NIH grants ￼. In COVID, it was figures like Fauci, Collins, and their chosen circle crafting narratives and influencing journals (e.g., behind-the-scenes editing of the Lancet letter and “Proximal Origin” paper). By gatekeeping, they ensured that alternative viewpoints were kept out of credible venues.
	•	Silencing & Smearing Dissent (S): Rather than engaging critics on the evidence, the establishment moved to silence them. Dissenters were painted as dangerous. We saw Hardy telling a rival to basically “shut up, you’re harming patients”; we saw leading public health voices insinuate that lab-leak proponents were xenophobic or that vaccine skeptics “want people to die.” This smear strategy often involved impugning motives – e.g., implying a scientist challenging amyloid was doing it for attention or a doctor warning about vaccine side effects was an anti-vaccine partisan. By attacking character, they avoided addressing the substance of the claims. Media allies played a role here: many news articles in 2020–2021 introduced anyone questioning the official COVID line with pejorative labels (“fringe, far-right, discredited”) ensuring readers viewed them with suspicion from the outset.
	•	Labeling Truth as Misinformation (L): The ultimate gaslighting is when true or justified concerns are branded as “false.” This happened explicitly during COVID. For instance, the BMJ whistleblower report – entirely factual – was algorithmically tagged as possible misinformation on social media ￼. Discussions of scientific uncertainty were collapsed into a binary of true/false that misrepresented dissent as lies. In the Alzheimer’s story, “misinformation” labels were not applied via algorithms, but the concept was similar: critics were said to be spreading baseless doubt or “causing harm”. In both cases, institutions acted as arbiters of truth, even as their own claims later proved shaky. This abuse of authority eroded trust – a bitter irony since it was ostensibly done to preserve trust.
	•	Institutional Inversion & Blame Shifting (I): Perhaps the most striking pattern is how institutions accused dissenters of the very malfeasance that the institutions themselves were committing. NIH leaders and amyloid proponents accused critics of “harming patients” or “undermining science,” when in reality it was their fraudulent science and narrow-mindedness that harmed patients by delaying genuine progress ￼. Pandemic officials insinuated that those raising the lab leak or safety questions were politicizing science – yet it was later clear that some officials had indeed politicized and manipulated science by concealing their own possible culpability (in funding Wuhan research) or by trying to hurry a simplistic public compliance. This is classic gaslighting: making someone feel crazy or immoral for seeing a problem that truly exists. The result was often that well-meaning professionals self-censored; many scientists who privately had doubts kept their heads down, for fear of these attacks.
	•	Media Collusion & Narrative Enforcement: Both cases benefited from a largely compliant press. Investigative journalism eventually cracked the cases (Science’s Charles Piller for Alzheimer’s; a mix of congressional digging and independent journalists for COVID), but for long stretches, major media outlets parroted the official lines. Whether due to limited expertise, fear of losing access, or alignment with noble-sounding goals, the media often became a megaphone for the establishment rather than a watchdog. This allowed faulty narratives to entrench. Additionally, in the pandemic, tech platforms became de facto media, algorithmically amplifying certain views and burying others. Never before had we seen such centralized control of information on a global scale – a fact that some commentators find as alarming as the misinformation it was meant to combat.

In mythological terms, one could say these institutions stole the fire of truth and hid it, leaving the populace in the dark – until a few Promethean individuals (the whistleblowers, the independent investigators) daringly reclaimed that fire. The righteous vindication of these individuals, when it finally comes, is often muted. There are rarely formal apologies. John Hardy did not, for example, publicly apologize to Dr. Perry for telling him to stop asking questions – instead he continues to downplay how much the fraud mattered ￼. Dr. Fauci upon retiring did not concede that perhaps more openness to the lab leak theory would have been wise; rather he maintained that all actions were in good faith. Good faith they may have been, but they were bad science in retrospect – science that eschewed self-correction. The damage of gaslighting in these cases is not only personal (to the ostracized individuals) but societal: when the truth is delayed, people suffer needlessly. Millions of Alzheimer’s patients over decades saw no effective treatment and families were given false hope because research was stuck on the wrong track ￼. In the pandemic, one can argue that early suppression of lab leak inquiries delayed important biosafety reforms, and overzealous vaccine mandates (fueled by one-dimensional messaging) contributed to polarization and perhaps even avoidable injuries in lower-risk groups – outcomes that ultimately harm the cause of public health.

Conclusion: From “Grandma Killers” to Grandma’s Protectors

GrannyGate is a cautionary tale of how institutional narratives can veer into grand delusions, and how those who challenge them – often at great personal cost – perform a service to society. The phrase “grandma killers,” hurled at contrarians, was a powerful bit of gaslighting. It implied that compliance with the orthodox view was the only way to save our elders, and that any dissent was equivalent to endangering the innocent. Yet, as we have seen, the true protectors of our grandmothers (and grandfathers, and all vulnerable people) were often the ones brave enough to question false consensus.

In the Alzheimer’s saga, it is tragically literal: had the scientific community listened sooner to those questioning the amyloid hypothesis, we might have developed alternative treatments or diagnostics by now, potentially alleviating suffering for millions of grandparents. The “conspiracy theorists” in this realm were the scientists who hypothesized that Alzheimer’s is more complex than a single protein – an idea now validated as the amyloid-alone approach falters. They were trying to protect future patients from the consequences of a myopic research agenda. In the COVID saga, those derided as “grandma killers” for opposing certain policies were in many cases advocating for more targeted protection of the vulnerable. Epidemiologists who argued against prolonged general lockdowns (like the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration) suggested focusing on protecting the elderly while letting society function – a strategy worthy of debate, not demonization. Doctors who warned that vaccinating a frail 90-year-old was not the same risk-benefit as forcing a healthy teenager – and that blanket mandates could erode public trust – were making a compassionate point: we should protect grandmas without potentially harming the grandkids unnecessarily. Similarly, those who pressed for the lab leak investigation did so in part to ensure accountability and precautions that would keep everyone’s grandma safe from future engineered pathogens.

The mythopoetic framing of GrannyGate casts the dissenters as heroes in a modern myth: the villagers who cried out that the emperor had no clothes, the Cassandras who spoke true prophecies no one initially heeded. They were ridiculed, shunned, labeled mad – yet time proved them right. There is indeed a righteous vindication in seeing the scientific record corrected and public narratives realigned with reality. But this is not a story with a perfectly happy ending. In both Alzheimer’s and COVID, the vindication comes after harm was done. Scientific fraud and censorship are not victimless crimes; their victims are the patients who don’t get effective cures, the citizens who lose faith in institutions, and the truth itself which takes on casualties in the crossfire.

However, there is hope and a lesson. The GrannyGate exposé shows that science’s self-correcting mechanism, though slow, is real. Truth can be suppressed for a time, but not forever. The key is fostering a culture that welcomes critique rather than punishing it. We must reform institutions so that “dissenting” no longer equals “career suicide”. Regulators and funding agencies must be as vigilant about groupthink as they are about fringe theories. And media must reclaim their role as neutral investigators rather than narrative enforcers.

In the end, the people who were gaslit “as f***” (to borrow the colloquial intensity of GASLIT-AF) were not crackpots – they were the proverbial canaries in the coal mine. Instead of smothering the canaries, we should listen to their early warning. The next time authorities insist that all critics are simply conspiracy theorists or dangerous lunatics, remember GrannyGate. Remember how many lives might have been saved or improved if we had paid attention to the dissenting few. The protectors of grandmas may well be those brave enough to tell Grandma (and the world) an uncomfortable truth, rather than a comforting lie.
