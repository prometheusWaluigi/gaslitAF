# Suppressed Cancer Signals in the Post-Vaccine Era

## Epidemiological Red Flags: Cancer and Excess Mortality Trends

Multiple countries have witnessed unexplained upticks in cancer incidence and mortality following the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. In Japan, for example, age-adjusted cancer death rates **reversed a decade-long decline** and showed **statistically significant excess mortality** in 2021 (1.1% above expected) that **doubled to 2.1% in 2022** ([

Six specific cancers – ovarian, leukemia, prostate, oral/pharyngeal, pancreatic, and breast – all spiked well beyond historical norms, a pattern unlikely to be explained by pandemic healthcare delays alone ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077472/#:~:text=PIs,cancer%20in%20women%20in%202021)). Notably, the first significant jump in monthly cancer deaths occurred **immediately after mass vaccination campaigns** (e.g. August 2021), not during the initial 2020 COVID wave ([

Such temporal alignment with vaccination, rather than with the earlier pandemic disruption, raised sharp concerns that have been largely ignored by health authorities.

These cancer surges are part of a broader **excess mortality anomaly** observed in highly vaccinated populations, especially among younger, working-age groups that historically have low baseline mortality. In the United States, **life insurance actuaries recorded unprecedented death spikes** in late 2021: a **40% increase in mortality among 18–64 year-olds** compared to pre-pandemic levels ([Insurance executive says death rates among working-age people up 40 percent](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/insurance-death-rates-working-age-people-up-40-percent#:~:text=Davison%20said%20death%20rates%20among,pandemic%20levels)). To put this in perspective, a **10% increase** would be a once-in-200-year event – so **40% is beyond catastrophic** ([Insurance executive says death rates among working-age people up 40 percent](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/insurance-death-rates-working-age-people-up-40-percent#:~:text=Davison%20said%20death%20rates%20among,pandemic%20levels)) ([Insurance executive says death rates among working-age people up 40 percent](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/insurance-death-rates-working-age-people-up-40-percent#:~:text=levels)). While some of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19, industry data indicated a large share were **non-COVID causes** occurring after the vaccination drive, suggesting a **novel mortality signal** that begged investigation. An actuarial report from the Society of Actuaries similarly found that the **35–44 age group** experienced nearly a **50% jump in all-cause deaths in 2021** – the worst deviation of any cohort ([Insurance executive says death rates among working-age people up 40 percent](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/insurance-death-rates-working-age-people-up-40-percent#:~:text=Davison%20said%20death%20rates%20among,pandemic%20levels)). Such aberrations in younger demographics, who have minimal COVID risk, correlate with the timing of mass vaccine boosters rather than the virus itself.

**“Turbo cancer”** – a term for unexpectedly aggressive or accelerated cancers post-vaccination – has entered the lexicon as doctors report seeing malignancies that **“explode” in progression**. While mainstream experts rush to dismiss these reports as anecdotal or ascribing them to delayed screenings, the **underlying data speak to a real trend**. Even a recent Reuters “fact-check” tacitly admitted that **cancer diagnoses in under-50s have been rising** (in the U.S., UK, Japan) ([Fact Check: Rise in under-50s cancer diagnoses predates COVID-19 vaccines | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/rise-under-50s-cancer-diagnoses-predates-covid-19-vaccines-2025-01-20/#:~:text=While%20it%20is%20true%20that,back%20to%20at%20least%202000)), yet it insisted this **“predates the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by decades”** and thus cannot be linked ([Fact Check: Rise in under-50s cancer diagnoses predates COVID-19 vaccines | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/rise-under-50s-cancer-diagnoses-predates-covid-19-vaccines-2025-01-20/#:~:text=Jan%2020%20,cancer%E2%80%9D%20in%20younger%20age%20groups)) ([Fact Check: Rise in under-50s cancer diagnoses predates COVID-19 vaccines | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/rise-under-50s-cancer-diagnoses-predates-covid-19-vaccines-2025-01-20/#:~:text=While%20it%20is%20true%20that,back%20to%20at%20least%202000)). This glib explanation ignores the possibility that a long-term rise was **exacerbated or accelerated** in the post-vaccine period. In the U.K., oncologists like **Professor Angus Dalgleish** have observed an **“explosion” of cancer relapses and new tumors** “particularly after the boosters,” with melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia, and kidney cancers **rebounding aggressively** in patients who had been in remission ([ Covid-19: Response and Excess Deaths - Hansard - UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-04-18/debates/9F01F787-D758-43D4-B8D1-4FA357EB3EED/Covid-19ResponseAndExcessDeaths#:~:text=Worryingly%2C%20Professor%20Dalgleish%20also%20notes,concludes%20with%20the%20following%20warning)). Such observations, coming from a leading cancer researcher (Dalgleish is one of the most cited oncologists in the UK ([ Covid-19: Response and Excess Deaths - Hansard - UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-04-18/debates/9F01F787-D758-43D4-B8D1-4FA357EB3EED/Covid-19ResponseAndExcessDeaths#:~:text=match%20at%20L2335%20Angus%20Dalgleish%2C,Berlin%20on%20this%20very%20issue))), should have set off alarm bells. Instead, they’ve been met with stonewalling.

## Immune Dysregulation: IgG4 Antibodies and T-Cell Exhaustion

Mechanistic research is starting to illuminate how repeated mRNA vaccination *could* contribute to cancer proliferation – yet these biological signals are being largely ignored. One striking finding is that the immune profile induced by multiple mRNA shots shifts in an unexpected way: the vaccines **cause a class-switch of antibodies toward IgG4**, an antibody subclass normally associated with tolerance (as seen in allergen immunotherapy) rather than antiviral defense ([
            Increased Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality After the Third mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Dose During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077472/#:~:text=respectively%20,explain%20excess%20mortality%20for%20all)). A recent *Science Immunology* study showed **spike-specific IgG4 levels rising sharply after the 2nd and 3rd mRNA doses** ([
            Increased Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality After the Third mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Dose During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077472/#:~:text=respectively%20,explain%20excess%20mortality%20for%20all)). This is not a benign quirk – IgG4 antibodies **“block” the cancer-fighting functions** of IgG1 antibodies, as demonstrated in experiments where non-specific IgG4 administration led to **“dramatic acceleration of growth”** in implanted breast and colon tumors ([
            Increased Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality After the Third mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Dose During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077472/#:~:text=Another%C2%A0study%20found%20that%20non,IgG4%20levels%20rose%20in%20the)). In patients with IgG4-related disease, the risk of malignancy is significantly elevated ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077472/#:~:text=of%20non,04)). In short, by **skewing the immune response toward an IgG4-dominant profile**, repeated vaccination may be inducing an immune tolerance state that **leaves the body defenseless against nascent cancers**. Researchers have explicitly warned that chronic exposure to the spike protein antigen could trigger such a switch and **“cause uncontrolled growth of cancer cells”** via this mechanism ([
            Increased Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality After the Third mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Dose During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077472/#:~:text=respectively%20,explain%20excess%20mortality%20for%20all)) ([

In parallel, evidence is emerging that **T-cell mediated immunity is being blunted** with repeated boosters. Doctors have observed clinical cases of **“immune exhaustion”**, where markers of T-cell dysfunction (like PD-1 upregulation) appear after the third dose ([
            Evidence of exhausted lymphocytes after the third anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in cancer patients - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9808030/#:~:text=after%20the%20third%20vaccine%20dose%2C,checkpoint)). A study of cancer patients after booster shots found **exhausted CD8+ T-cells** that **lost their virus-fighting and tumor-surveillance capacity**, persisting alongside high viral loads ([
            Evidence of exhausted lymphocytes after the third anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in cancer patients - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9808030/#:~:text=after%20the%20third%20vaccine%20dose%2C,checkpoint)) ([
            Evidence of exhausted lymphocytes after the third anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in cancer patients - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9808030/#:~:text=these%20cells%20to%20control%20viral,checkpoint)). The authors noted this **dysfunctional, senescent T-cell state** – characterized by “checkpoint” inhibitory receptors and low cytokine production – is exactly what one would fear if **repetitive antigenic stimulation** (constant spike exposure) were overwhelming the immune system ([
            Evidence of exhausted lymphocytes after the third anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in cancer patients - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9808030/#:~:text=after%20the%20third%20vaccine%20dose%2C,checkpoint)) ([
            Evidence of exhausted lymphocytes after the third anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in cancer patients - PMC

In plain terms, the **cellular soldiers of the immune system are worn out**, which could open the door for latent viruses and malignant cells to spread unchecked. Supporting this, clinicians have reported reactivation of oncogenic viruses (like EBV, HPV, and HHV-8) following mRNA vaccination in some patients ([
            Increased Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality After the Third mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Dose During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077472/#:~:text=The%20SARS,and%20later%20doses%20was%20underway)). These viruses can directly cause cancers (e.g. EBV and lymphomas, HPV and cervical/oropharyngeal cancers, HHV-8 and Kaposi’s sarcoma) when not kept in dormancy by a vigilant immune system ([
            Increased Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality After the Third mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Dose During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11077472/#:~:text=reactivation%20of%20latent%20viruses%20such,and%20later%20doses%20was%20underway)). By potentially **weakening T-cell surveillance**, mass vaccination campaigns might inadvertently be **removing the failsafes that usually keep tumor growth and chronic viruses in check** ([
            Increased Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality After the Third mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine Dose During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan - PMC

## Genetic Footprints: mRNA Technology and Oncogenesis

Beyond immune modulation, several disturbing findings point to the **genomic risks** of the new mRNA technology – risks that regulators have so far swept under the rug. The mRNA vaccines were touted to **“not alter DNA”**, but laboratory studies tell a more troubling story. In a peer-reviewed study from Lund University, Sweden, researchers found that the Pfizer mRNA (BNT162b2) **is taken up by human liver cells *in vitro* and reverse-transcribed into DNA within 6 hours** ([Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73#:~:text=In%20this%20study%20we%20present,transcription%20is%20through%20endogenous%20reverse)). The mechanism was traced to our cells’ endogenous retrotransposon machinery (LINE-1), which the vaccine was shown to activate, shuttling the spike mRNA into the cell’s nucleus ([Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73#:~:text=transcribed%20intracellularly%20into%20DNA%20as,1%20is%20elevated%20by%20BNT162b2)). While the study did not show integration into chromosomes, it definitively proved the mRNA **can become DNA** in a human cell line ([Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73#:~:text=In%20this%20study%20we%20present,transcription%20is%20through%20endogenous%20reverse)) – shattering the absolutist claim that such a thing was impossible. This raises the **nightmarish scenario** that in some cells, the vaccine’s genetic code could integrate or affect genomic stability. The authors stressed that further studies are needed on whole genomes of exposed cells ([Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73#:~:text=match%20at%20L810%20side%20effects,as%20tissues%20from%20human%20subjects)), but no such urgency is seen from health agencies. Instead of investigating, the response was dismissal and even **AP News “fact checks”** hair-splitting that the Swedish study only showed conversion to DNA “in certain lab cells,” as if that wasn’t exactly the first step of genome modification ([Swedish study on COVID vaccines and DNA misinterpreted - AP News](https://apnews.com/article/Fact-Check-COVID-Vaccine-Sweden-Study-986569377766#:~:text=Swedish%20study%20on%20COVID%20vaccines,)).

In a related vein, independent analysis of the vaccine contents uncovered something **truly alarming**: contamination with a **Simian Virus 40 (SV40) DNA enhancer sequence**. SV40 is a known oncogenic virus, and its DNA was infamously present in polio vaccines of the 1950s–60s, suspected of causing cancers ([No evidence that DNA sequence used in Pfizer shot leads to cancer ...](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-covid-vaccine-pfizer-SV40-DNA-853343189368#:~:text=...%20apnews.com%20%20Pfizer%27s%20COVID,cause%20health%20problems%2C%20including%20cancer)) ([Emergent Human Pathogen Simian Virus 40 and Its Role in Cancer](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452549/#:~:text=Emergent%20Human%20Pathogen%20Simian%20Virus,and%20lymphomas%20in%20laboratory%20animals)). In the case of Pfizer’s vaccine, the *SV40 sequence is not the whole virus*, but a **promoter/enhancer from its genome** – essentially a genetic snippet historically used in gene therapy vectors to **drive DNA into the nucleus** of human cells ([ Covid-19: Response and Excess Deaths - Hansard - UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-04-18/debates/9F01F787-D758-43D4-B8D1-4FA357EB3EED/Covid-19ResponseAndExcessDeaths#:~:text=His%20concern%20has%20been%20considered,contaminant%2C%20simian%20virus%2040%2C%20is)). A pharmaceutical quality control scientist, Kevin McKernan, found this SV40 enhancer in residual DNA plasmids in the vaccine, and his results have since been corroborated by others. Regulatory agencies have **acknowledged** the presence of “non-functional fragments” of SV40 DNA used in the manufacturing process, albeit claiming that these are present only in “very low levels” ([No evidence that DNA sequence used in Pfizer shot leads to cancer and other health issues | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-covid-vaccine-pfizer-SV40-DNA-853343189368#:~:text=The%20European%20Medicines%20Agency%2C%20which,material%E2%80%9D%20in%20producing%20the%20vaccine)). The European Medicines Agency admitted the sequence is used as a **“starting material”** and that trace amounts **“might still remain”** in the final shots ([No evidence that DNA sequence used in Pfizer shot leads to cancer and other health issues | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-covid-vaccine-pfizer-SV40-DNA-853343189368#:~:text=The%20European%20Medicines%20Agency%2C%20which,material%E2%80%9D%20in%20producing%20the%20vaccine)) ([No evidence that DNA sequence used in Pfizer shot leads to cancer and other health issues | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-covid-vaccine-pfizer-SV40-DNA-853343189368#:~:text=But%20those%20materials%20are%20broken,well%20within%20established%20safety%20guidelines)). Yet they **blithely assert** there’s no evidence these fragments cause harm, without any dedicated studies to back that confidence ([No evidence that DNA sequence used in Pfizer shot leads to cancer and other health issues | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-covid-vaccine-pfizer-SV40-DNA-853343189368#:~:text=But%20those%20materials%20are%20broken,well%20within%20established%20safety%20guidelines)). **Independent experts strongly disagree** – Professor Dalgleish points out that the SV40 enhancer’s very purpose is to facilitate gene integration, warning that its presence means **“they are not vaccines at all but genetically modified organisms”** that should have undergone specialized safety testing ([ Covid-19: Response and Excess Deaths - Hansard - UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-04-18/debates/9F01F787-D758-43D4-B8D1-4FA357EB3EED/Covid-19ResponseAndExcessDeaths#:~:text=findings)). Instead of addressing these concerns, institutions have largely kept quiet or issued boilerplate denials.

Perhaps the most striking (and telling) case of potential mechanistic harm comes from the realm of DNA damage repair. A team of scientists reported in late 2021 that the SARS-CoV-2 **spike protein itself** – the antigen encoded by all the vaccines – **can enter the cell nucleus and interfere with the DNA repair machinery** ([
            SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538446/#:~:text=vitro%20cell%20line%2C%20we%20report,based%20vaccines)). In their experiments, spike protein (expressed in cultured cells) **blocked the recruitment of tumor-suppressor proteins BRCA1 and 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage** ([
            SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538446/#:~:text=vitro%20cell%20line%2C%20we%20report,based%20vaccines)). BRCA1, of course, is famous for its role in preventing breast and ovarian cancers, and 53BP1 is critical for repairing double-strand DNA breaks. The authors showed that when spike hampered these repair factors, the efficiency of DNA fix-up dropped, and **V(D)J recombination** – the process by which our immune cells diversify, also a DNA break-and-repair process – was inhibited ([
            SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538446/#:~:text=exhibit%20delayed%20and%20weak%20adaptive,based)) ([
            SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538446/#:~:text=vitro%20cell%20line%2C%20we%20report,based%20vaccines)). They explicitly cautioned that this could impair adaptive immunity and **“underscore the potential side effects of full-length spike-based vaccines”** ([
            SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538446/#:~:text=vitro%20cell%20line%2C%20we%20report,based%20vaccines)). What was the response to this urgent finding? **The paper was retracted within months.** No evidence of fraud or error was publicly demonstrated; it was removed after an “expression of concern,” likely under intense pressure because its implications were so damning to the vaccine narrative. Retraction is a career-death sentence in science, and here it was used as a cudgel to wipe inconvenient results off the record. This heavy-handed approach did nothing to disprove the data – it only sent a chilling message to other researchers. Indeed, a separate in-silico study by other scientists also found that the spike’s S2 subunit could bind to **p53 and BRCA2**, disrupting their function ([S2 subunit of SARS-nCoV-2 interacts with tumor suppressor protein ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936523320303065#:~:text=S2%20subunit%20of%20SARS,terminal%20domain)) ([S2 subunit of SARS-nCoV-2 interacts with tumor suppressor protein ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936523320303065#:~:text=,terminal%20domain)). Instead of mobilizing a crash research program into these risks, the establishment attacked the messengers and **buried the message**.

## Suppression, Gaslighting, and Data Manipulation

Faced with these signals – rising cancers, weird immune effects, plausible biological mechanisms – one would expect public health institutions to vigorously investigate. Instead, we have seen a pattern of **denial, obfuscation, and even apparent data tampering**. Whistleblowers have come forward with evidence that, rather than honestly addressing safety signals, authorities actively quashed them:

- **Military Epidemiology Database (DMED) Scandal:**  In early 2022, whistleblower military doctors leaked DMED data showing astronomical increases in 2021 diagnoses among Department of Defense personnel. The database – which tracks illnesses in active service members – recorded a **487% rise in breast cancer**, **474% rise in thyroid cancer**, and **369% rise in testicular cancer** in 2021, compared to the average from 2016–2020 ([Sen.

These stunning figures were presented in a U.S. Senate hearing; the DOD’s response was not to express concern or announce an inquiry, but to claim that **a “glitch” had undercounted diagnoses in previous years** – essentially **revoking the data after the fact** ([Fact Check: DoD says data error caused spike in numbers ... - Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/dod-says-data-error-caused-spike-in-numbers-of-medical-diagnoses-in-their-medica-idUSL1N2UY1S2/#:~:text=Fact%20Check%3A%20DoD%20says%20data,of%20disease%20among%20military)) ([Numbers were based on faulty data, military spokesperson says](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/31/instagram-posts/numbers-were-based-faulty-data-military-spokespers/#:~:text=Numbers%20were%20based%20on%20faulty,health%20issues%20in%202021%2C%20acc)). The odds that only cancer and serious illness data were affected by a multiyear “glitch” defy credulity. The far more plausible explanation is that DMED accidentally revealed a truth that was **meant to stay hidden**, and once caught, the system operators scrambled to *retroactively adjust the baseline* and write off the 2021 spike as an artifact. To date, there has been **no independent audit of DMED** and no transparent release of the “corrected” numbers; the issue has simply been swept under the rug by the Pentagon.

- **Civilian Health Agencies – See No Evil:**  The CDC and FDA have similarly exhibited a resolute incuriosity toward cancer signals. The CDC’s official stance, parroted by media “fact-checkers,” is that there is **“no evidence” of any increase in cancers among the vaccinated** ([Cancer rate not up 20 times from COVID-19 vaccines | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-228836931193#:~:text=AP%E2%80%99S%20ASSESSMENT%3A%20False,more%20susceptible%20to%20developing%20cancer)). According to an AP News piece, *U.S. oncologists unanimously report no spike in cancer rates* and nothing in clinical trial data suggests a problem ([Cancer rate not up 20 times from COVID-19 vaccines | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-228836931193#:~:text=AP%E2%80%99S%20ASSESSMENT%3A%20False,more%20susceptible%20to%20developing%20cancer)). This statement is **breathtakingly dishonest** – it ignores the many oncologists who *have* spoken up, and conveniently omits that **no trial was ever designed** to detect long-term cancer outcomes. It also brushes aside the USA’s own mortality data: the CDC’s statistics show **608,000 cancer deaths in 2022**, up from ~599,000 in 2019 (pre-pandemic) ([Cancer Data and Statistics - CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/data/index.html#:~:text=Cancer%20Data%20and%20Statistics%20,2021%20is%20the)) ([Cancer Data and Statistics - CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/data/index.html#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%20in,2021%20is%20the)). Any rise will be explained away as due to aging population or delayed diagnoses; *what isn’t being done* is a rigorous **comparison of cancer rates in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated cohorts** (e.g. using Vaccine Safety Datalink or other large databases). Why not? The agencies simply do not want to look. In fact, the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) **stopped publishing its data on mortality by vaccination status** once those analyses started to show uncomfortable patterns (such as higher non-COVID mortality in the boosted vs. unboosted) ([ Covid-19: Response and Excess Deaths - Hansard - UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-04-18/debates/9F01F787-D758-43D4-B8D1-4FA357EB3EED/Covid-19ResponseAndExcessDeaths#:~:text=One%20does%20not%20need%20any,longer%20does%20so%2C%20and%20no)). As one Member of Parliament put it, *“Officials deliberately hiding key data”* – the ONS data suppression being a prime example – and he noted future generations will be **“agog that the evidence was ignored for so long, ... and those raising it were gaslit, smeared and vilified.”** ([ Covid-19: Response and Excess Deaths - Hansard - UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-04-18/debates/9F01F787-D758-43D4-B8D1-4FA357EB3EED/Covid-19ResponseAndExcessDeaths#:~:text=the%20House%20in%20all%20seriousness,were%20gaslit%2C%20smeared%20and%20vilified)).

- **Institutional Intimidation of Dissent:** Doctors and scientists who voice concern are being systematically attacked. When pathologists and oncologists like Dr. Ryan Cole or Prof. Dalgleish share their clinical observations of post-vaccine cancers, they are ridiculed as cranks or accused of spreading “misinformation.” In the Reuters fact-check cited above, Dr. Paul Marik – a distinguished critical care physician – was introduced only as someone who had his board certification revoked (appealing to authority to discredit him) ([Fact Check: Rise in under-50s cancer diagnoses predates COVID-19 vaccines | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/rise-under-50s-cancer-diagnoses-predates-covid-19-vaccines-2025-01-20/#:~:text=A%20news%20bulletin%20%2C%20opens,American%20Board%20of%20Internal%20Medicine)). The **substance of his warning** (that he’s seeing a cancer explosion in young patients) was dismissed without investigation. This **gaslighting** culture creates a chilling effect: other physicians see what happens to these “heretics” and thus keep quiet about what they’re witnessing. The net effect is a **silencing of feedback from the front lines** of medicine.

- **Data Withholding and Manipulation:** Pfizer’s own clinical trial and post-marketing data contain signals that were downplayed or hidden. In Pfizer’s pivotal trial, there was a **numerical increase in all-cause deaths in the vaccine group (21) vs placebo (17)** by the 6-month cutoff ([Interview resurfaces a years-old Pfizer vaccine trial myth](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/alerts/interview-resurfaces-a-years-old-pfizer-vaccine-trial-myth/#:~:text=myth%20publichealthcollaborative,than%20placebo%20in%20clinical%20trials)) ([Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine ...](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345#:~:text=Safety%20and%20Efficacy%20of%20the,between%20BNT162b2%20and%20placebo)) – including more cardiac deaths among the vaccinated. Instead of treating this imbalance as a safety signal (traditionally, any excess deaths in a vaccine group demand scrutiny), Pfizer and the FDA simply declared **“none of the deaths were related to the vaccine”** ([Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine ...](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345#:~:text=Safety%20and%20Efficacy%20of%20the,between%20BNT162b2%20and%20placebo)), offering no autopsy evidence or analysis to justify that bald assertion. Additionally, a court-forced FOIA release of Pfizer’s post-authorization safety report (covering Dec 2020 – Feb 2021) revealed **1,223 reported deaths and over 42,000 case reports of adverse events** in the first three months of rollout ([Fact Check: Pages of suspected side effects released about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine ‘may not have any causal relationship’ to the jab, company says | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/pages-of-suspected-side-effects-released-about-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-may-no-idUSL2N2VK1G1/#:~:text=It%20compiled%20data%20from%2063,%E2%80%9Cadverse%20events%20of%20special%20interest%E2%80%9D)) ([Fact Check: Pages of suspected side effects released about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine ‘may not have any causal relationship’ to the jab, company says | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/pages-of-suspected-side-effects-released-about-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-may-no-idUSL2N2VK1G1/#:~:text=Examples%20of%20such%20events%20are,here)). Instead of publicizing this and investigating each category of injury, the FDA and Pfizer buried it. The FDA had **wanted to seal these documents for 75 years** – an utterly inexcusable stance for data pertaining to billions of injections. It was only due to a lawsuit that the information came out, and Pfizer’s response was to claim that *correlation is not causation* ([Fact Check: Pages of suspected side effects released about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine ‘may not have any causal relationship’ to the jab, company says | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/pages-of-suspected-side-effects-released-about-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-may-no-idUSL2N2VK1G1/#:~:text=Nine%20pages%20of%20adverse%20event,that%20the%20list%20is%20definitive)) ([Fact Check: Pages of suspected side effects released about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine ‘may not have any causal relationship’ to the jab, company says | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/pages-of-suspected-side-effects-released-about-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-may-no-idUSL2N2VK1G1/#:~:text=Examples%20of%20such%20events%20are,here)), while media fact-checkers dutifully emphasized that these adverse events were “not confirmed” to be caused by the vaccine. Technically true, perhaps – but the **proper scientific approach** is to regard such a huge volume of serious adverse events as **signals screaming for follow-up**, not as a P.R. problem to be managed. The handling of the Pfizer documents typifies institutional **epistemic capture**: regulators tasked with guarding the public instead protect the product, even to the point of fighting in court to keep safety data secret. When that failed, they simply ignored the contents and relied on the press to mollify the public.

## Epistemic Capture and the Collapse of Safety Oversight

The patterns above point to a **systemic failure of our safety monitoring and knowledge-generation process** – a failure fueled by what can only be described as **institutional epistemic capture**. Public health agencies, medical journals, and the media have become so invested in the “safe and effective” vaccine narrative that they are structurally incapable of processing any information to the contrary. We have, in effect, **disabled the feedback loops** that are supposed to catch warning signs in large-scale medical interventions. Normally, rising all-cause mortality in younger populations or unusual cancer clusters would trigger urgent investigations – but here those signals are either waved away with sophistries or not even officially measured. The **coherence of the entire safety surveillance apparatus has collapsed**: it is offering reassurances that **directly contradict** the empirical data emerging on the ground.

This collapse in coherence is most evident in the stark contrast between **two parallel narratives**. On one hand, the official line insists there is *no cancer risk, no mechanistic plausibility, and no credible evidence* linking COVID vaccines to any serious long-term effect. On the other hand, we have presented: excess death statistics, peer-reviewed mechanistic studies, renowned doctors raising alarms, and real-world clinical observations – all suggesting a possible link to turbo-charged cancers and immune dysregulation. A healthy system would treat these as serious hypotheses to be tested. Instead, the mainstream machinery reflexively labels them “misinformation” without debate. The result is a dangerous **blind spot**: if the vaccines *are* in fact contributing to increased cancers or other chronic illnesses, the current institutional setup is almost **designed to miss it**. By the time the truth can no longer be denied, it may be too late for countless people.

**Institutional capture** by pharmaceutical interests and groupthink has created an environment where **no amount of adverse data can penetrate**. The agencies rely on highly vaccinated populations (making control groups small or non-existent), apply ever more **narrow definitions of vaccine injury**, and shift blame to other factors (e.g. “lockdown effects” or “long COVID” or **decades-old trends** ([Fact Check: Rise in under-50s cancer diagnoses predates COVID-19 vaccines | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/rise-under-50s-cancer-diagnoses-predates-covid-19-vaccines-2025-01-20/#:~:text=Jan%2020%20,cancer%E2%80%9D%20in%20younger%20age%20groups))). This *structural gaslighting* extends to academic publishing – where papers that find problems are retracted or never accepted – and to research funding, which is unavailable for follow-up studies that might “prove the wrong thing.” Such **epistemic suppression** ensures that feedback loops – like pharmacovigilance databases, actuarial analyses, and clinicians’ observations – never translate into policy change or even public awareness. Instead of the **safety signal detection system** adjusting our course, it has been hijacked to prop up a predetermined course.

In summary, the strongest evidence we have indicates: **unprecedented spikes in mortality and aggressive cancers temporally following mRNA vaccine rollouts** ([Insurance executive says death rates among working-age people up 40 percent](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/insurance-death-rates-working-age-people-up-40-percent#:~:text=Davison%20said%20death%20rates%20among,pandemic%20levels)) ([

This confluence of evidence, and the blatant refusal of institutions to even *entertain* it, should alarm any unbiased observer. The **feedback loops essential to scientific and medical integrity have been effectively shut off**. What remains is an illusion of safety – a mainstream narrative maintained by **gaslighting dissenters and concealing inconvenient data**. As a result, we are flying blind, with the very real possibility that a medical intervention, hailed as a triumph, could be seeding a slow-burning public health crisis. Only by breaking this epistemic capture – by demanding transparency, open debate, and honest data analysis – can we hope to restore the feedback mechanisms and address the potential “coherence collapse” at the heart of our health institutions. Anything less, and the pattern of concealment will continue, with devastating consequences for trust in medicine and for the lives potentially impacted by the signals no one in power would face.
