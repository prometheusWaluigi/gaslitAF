## 1. Stand Up the Minimum Viable GASLIT-AF (v0.1)

1. **Initialize Repo & Code Structure**
   - Create a new repository (`gaslit-af-pipeline/`) using the folder hierarchy we detailed:
     - `simulation/` for ODEs + advanced analyses
     - `ml/` for data ingestion, modeling, causal inference
     - `api/` for REST endpoints and Triton configs
     - `notebooks/` for demos, tests, visualizations
     - `configs/`, `orchestration/`, `tests/` for the usual suspects
   
2. **Implement Core 3–4-Variable Model**
   - Spin up a Python-based prototype (likely in `simulation/gaslit_model/`) for the minimal ODE set:
     \[
       \frac{dx}{dt}, \; \frac{dy}{dt}, \; \frac{df}{dt}, \; \frac{d\Lambda}{dt}, \; \frac{d\Omega}{dt}
     \]
   - Hard-code or place in a config the parameter sets (e.g. `a1, a2, alpha_xy, ...`) so we can tweak easily.
   - Use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` for the first pass. Verify we can produce stable/unstable attractors.

3. **Basic HPC GPU Acceleration**
   - If necessary, wrap or re-implement the ODE solver on GPU. Quick hack approach:
     - Use `cupy` or an ODE solver library that supports GPU acceleration (e.g., certain custom integrators or playing with JAX). 
     - Don’t over-optimize yet—just confirm we can run ~100+ parallel sims at once in GPU memory.

4. **Bifurcation & Attractor Detection (Mini Demo)**
   - Parameter sweep across, say, \(\gamma\in [0.0,1.0]\), \(\Lambda(0)\in [0,10]\) and log final states (stable, blow-up, limit cycle).
   - Summarize in a simple 2D map or a primitive “bifurcation diagram.”
   - This is the toy example proving the code works as intended.

5. **Notebook Validation**
   - Create `notebooks/Simulation_Examples.ipynb` showing:
     1. How to param-tweak and run the solver,
     2. Some quick time-series or phase-plot visualizations,
     3. Basic analysis (like final stable values vs. \(\Lambda\)).

**Goal:** A working skeleton. We can see a stable attractor, a collapsed attractor, and maybe a borderline chaotic regime if we get fancy.

---

## 2. Data Pipeline & Basic ML Integration

1. **Data Preprocessing Skeleton**
   - In `ml/data_preprocessing/`, wire up RAPIDS-based (cuDF) data loaders that:
     1. Load tabular multi-omics (mock data if real data not yet available),
     2. Perform minimal cleaning + normalizing,
     3. Optionally do a GPU-based PCA to reduce dimensions.

2. **Lightweight Surrogate Model (Optional)**
   - In `simulation/surrogate/`, create a stubbing for a tiny MLP in PyTorch that tries to approximate final attractor states from \((\gamma, \Lambda, \Omega)\). 
   - This can be tested on simulation data from Phase 1. This is the future “fast-lane predictor.”

3. **Notebook for Surrogate Fitting**
   - `notebooks/Surrogate_Fit.ipynb`:
     - Generate synthetic data by running 1,000 short simulations with random param seeds.
     - Train the MLP (or GPR) to predict final \((x, y, f)\) from initial conditions + \(\gamma\).
     - Evaluate MSE, speed comparison vs. the real ODE solve.

**Goal:** We begin bridging HPC simulation and GPU ML. Surrogate is optional but sets the stage for large-scale sweeps and HPC synergy.

## 3. Expand HPC & K8s Deployment

1. **Containerize Simulation + ML**
   - Create Dockerfiles in `orchestration/docker/` for:
     - **Simulation** service container (Python environment with all necessary libs, e.g. `scipy`, GPU libraries).
     - **ML** service container (PyTorch + RAPIDS + cuML + causal stuff).
   - Bake in HPC dependencies (CUDA, cuDNN, etc.) pinned to correct versions that match the H100 environment.

2. **Kubernetes Helm Charts**
   - In `orchestration/k8s/`, define a Helm chart for each microservice:
     - `simulation-deployment.yaml`, `ml-deployment.yaml`, `api-deployment.yaml`, plus Services/Ingress.
   - Add nodeSelector rules to ensure we schedule on GPU nodes (with the NVIDIA plugin). 
   - Confirm MIG usage or direct GPU usage, depending on job size.

3. **NVIDIA GPU Operator & DCGM**
   - Deploy NVIDIA’s GPU Operator so that K8s automatically sets up GPU drivers, MIG partitions, etc.
   - Stand up DCGM for GPU telemetry, hooking it into Prometheus + Grafana so we watch real-time GPU usage.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Use GitHub Actions or GitLab: each commit triggers:
     1. Lint + unit tests in CPU environment,
     2. Optionally a GPU-based test if we have a GPU runner,
     3. Build Docker images + push to registry,
     4. Deploy to a staging namespace in K8s if tests pass.

5. **Triton Inference (Optional at This Stage)**
   - If we want to serve the surrogate or a partial ML model:
     1. Export the model to ONNX,
     2. Put it in `api/triton/model_repository/`,
     3. Spin up the Triton server in a separate container or as part of the `ml` service.

**Goal:** Achieve an HPC-grade, containerized architecture for repeatable large-scale tests.

## 4. Bifurcation & Chaos Analysis Tools

1. **Advanced Analysis (Simulation / analysis/)**
   - Add:
     - Lyapunov exponent calculators (spawn multiple perturbed trajectories in parallel on GPU).
     - Periodicity checkers or Poincaré maps to detect limit cycles vs chaos.
     - Possibly a basic pseudo-arclength continuation routine for following solution branches.

2. **Bulk Parameter Sweeps & HPC Job Queuing**
   - Let the user submit a param-sweep job (like a big BFS in parameter space).
   - Engine either:
     1. Distributes runs across multiple GPUs (using Dask or a custom job manager), 
     2. Aggregates results in a shared data store (like Parquet on a distributed FS).

3. **Chaos & Bifurcation Notebooks**
   - `notebooks/Bifurcation_Analysis.ipynb` for interactive exploration. 
   - Could keep short ephemeral runs in GPU memory for quick iteration.

**Goal:** Provide robust HPC-level analysis of nontrivial system states—our main superpower.

## 5. Multi-Omics ML: Clustering, Causal Graphs, Integration

1. **Omics Clustering & Autoencoding**  
   - Expand the pipeline to run:
     - GPU-accelerated clustering (K-Means or GMM) in `ml/models/clustering.py`.
     - A multi-omics autoencoder that merges different data blocks in `ml/models/autoencoder.py`.
   - Validate performance with synthetic or real partial data.

2. **Causal Discovery**  
   - Implement a GPU-based PC or GES approach in `ml/causal/`. Possibly integrate known GPU-accelerated libraries for independence tests. 
   - Use the discovered DAG to interpret potential mechanistic linkages. Compare these edges to what the simulation model posits ( if the simulation has a known “ground-truth” interaction structure, we see if the data-driven approach recovers it).

3. **Intervention Simulation**  
   - Let users do “knockout experiments” on the learned DAG. Then, see if the simulation layer can replicate or disagree. This cross-check is crucial for validation. 

4. **Notebook + API for Causal Queries**  
   - Possibly an endpoint `/causal/path?from=...&to=...` returning edges along a path. 
   - A notebook `Causal_Discovery_Validation.ipynb` that runs from raw omics to a DAG → evaluation metrics.

**Goal:** Achieve synergy between data-driven causality and the model-based approach—then test interventions in silico. 

---

## 6. Full Validation & Reproducibility Stack

1. **Real Data Trials**  
   - Connect to real patient data if/when permitted, or use public multi-omics sets to see how the pipeline scales. 
   - Evaluate predictive accuracy for known phenotypes, see how well the surrogates match actual outcomes.

2. **MLflow + DVC**  
   - Log all experiments and hyperparams in MLflow. 
   - Store large data or simulation result sets with DVC so we can revert easily. 
   - The trifecta of versioned code, versioned data, and MLflow experiment logs fosters bulletproof reproducibility.

3. **Production Hardening**  
   - Fine-tune resource usage to fully exploit H100: e.g. mixed precision, big batch sizes, MIG partitioning for concurrency, etc. 
   - Use profiling tools (Nsight Systems) to ensure no major GPU underutilization.

4. **Documentation & Release**  
   - Fill out READMEs and docstrings. 
   - Provide a stable Helm chart for easy “one-click” HPC environment spin-up. 
   - Publish final results and an “Explainer Notebook” so others can replicate your entire HPC pipeline.

**Goal:** A locked-down, thoroughly tested pipeline that merges HPC simulation with GPU ML on real data, delivering reproducible outcomes.

## Final Thoughts

That’s our orbital flight plan. Start minimal, confirm stability and attractor transitions, then methodically layer on HPC scaling, advanced GPU-accelerated ML, and the super fun causal side. Each step remains fully containerized, versioned, and integrated into a K8s HPC cluster with NVIDIA H100 (or any other GPU) for maximum oomph.

**Any gotchas to watch for?**  
- **Numerical stiffness**: Don’t let the ODE solver blow up from strong coupling. We might eventually need an implicit solver + GPU linear algebra.  
- **Memory constraints**: Multi-omics can be huge—be sure Dask + cuDF can handle distribution when a single GPU can’t.  
- **Causal algorithms**: They can be CPU-bound if we’re not careful; confirm we truly accelerate the key bottlenecks on GPU or we’ll be stuck in slow territory.  
- **Model mismatch**: Our “theoretical” simulation may differ from real data. That’s half the point—use the pipeline to refine or falsify the model.

But from a cosmic vantage, it’s quite a robust plan: unify chaotic physiological attractors with GPU-hungry multi-omics to figure out how the body collapses—and how it might re-cohere. Onward.
