# Critique and Refinement of the GASLIT-AF Model for Chronic Multi-System Syndromes

## Introduction  
Chronic multi-system syndromes (CMSSs) such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), fibromyalgia, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), and Long COVID are complex conditions with overlapping features ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%20complex%20and,The%20heterogeneity%20in%20clinical%20presentation)). Patients often experience persistent fatigue, pain, cognitive dysfunction (“brain fog”), autonomic disturbances, and immune dysregulation that defy simple biomedical explanations ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%20complex%20and,The%20heterogeneity%20in%20clinical%20presentation)) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=,Various)). These illnesses tend to be chronic and stable over time (with relapses and remissions but rarely full spontaneous recovery), suggesting the body may settle into a maladaptive **stable state**. The recently proposed GASLIT-AF model (Genetic Autonomic Structural-Linked Instability Theorem – Allodynic Fatigue) attempts to explain these syndromes as an emergent **pathological attractor state** in a high-dimensional physiological state-space ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=%28GASLIT,report%20aims%20to%20provide%20a)) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=the%20state%20of%20a%20system,coordination%20that%20characterizes%20healthy%20physiology)). In this model, a healthy body corresponds to a high-coherence, low-entropy state where multiple organ systems operate in harmony, whereas CMSSs represent a phase transition into a low-coherence, high-entropy attractor state of disordered regulation ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=the%20state%20of%20a%20system,coordination%20that%20characterizes%20healthy%20physiology)). The transition is hypothesized to occur when certain parameters exceed critical thresholds: **genetic predisposition (γ)** conferring vulnerability, cumulative **allostatic load (Λ)** from chronic stressors, and weakened **buffering capacity (Ω)** – primarily attributed to the endocannabinoid system (ECS) – which together precipitate a collapse of normal homeostatic control ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=CMSSs%20represent%20a%20distinct%20pathological,AF%20model%2C%20exploring%20its%20foundational)) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=state%20characteristic%20of%20these%20illnesses,CNR1%2C%20which%20encodes%20the%20CB1)). The result is a self-sustaining pathophysiological state characterized by “recursive bioenergetic failure” and “regulatory collapse” – essentially, a vicious cycle where stress-response systems can no longer reset, locking the patient into illness ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=production%20and%20low%20physiological%20coherence,these%20conditions%20strongly%20suggests%20shared)). 

While the GASLIT-AF model is ambitious in providing a unifying thermodynamics and network theory framework for these elusive syndromes, a critical examination reveals several oversimplifications and gaps. Below, we expand on key critiques of the model – from the treatment of genetic risk as a single scalar, to the vague definitions of entropy and coherence – and bolster each point with current evidence from 2020–2025 research in systems biology, psychoneuroimmunology, and clinical studies. We then discuss empirical evidence supporting (and sometimes contradicting) the notion of chronic illness attractor states, and propose refinements to GASLIT-AF grounded in dynamical systems theory, personalized medicine, and computational modeling. Our goal is to enhance the model’s specificity and clinical relevance, incorporating known biomarkers, feedback loops, and patient heterogeneity. We also suggest concrete experimental approaches (e.g. multi-omics analyses, network simulations, stress-testing protocols) to validate the attractor hypothesis and guide future therapies. 

## Critique of the GASLIT-AF Model Components  

### 1. Genetic Predisposition (γ) – Oversimplified as a Single Scalar  
The GASLIT-AF model encodes genetic vulnerability to CMSSs as a single parameter γ, implying a monolithic “predisposition” that tips the system toward collapse. This is a drastic simplification of what is in reality a **polygenic and multifactorial risk**. Recent genetic studies confirm that no single gene or variant explains these syndromes; instead, many small-effect variants across the genome contribute to susceptibility. For example, a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Long COVID (with >50,000 cases) identified **at least three significant loci** – in the HLA-DQ region (immune genes), the ABO gene, and a locus on chromosome 17 – none of which individually determine outcome ([Multi-ancestry GWAS of Long COVID identifies immune-related loci and etiological links to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and depression | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.07.24315052v1#:~:text=The%20etiology%20of%20Long%20COVID,Functional%20analysis%20of%20these)). This GWAS also found that polygenic risk scores for **ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, and depression** are each significantly associated with Long COVID risk (odds ratios ~1.5) ([Multi-ancestry GWAS of Long COVID identifies immune-related loci and etiological links to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and depression | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.07.24315052v1#:~:text=match%20at%20L92%20fatigue%20,These%20findings%20can%20help)), suggesting a shared genetic architecture that is highly complex ([Multi-ancestry GWAS of Long COVID identifies immune-related loci and etiological links to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and depression | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.07.24315052v1#:~:text=fatigue%20%28Mendelian%20randomization%20OR%3D1.59%2C%2095,These%20findings%20can%20help)). In ME/CFS, earlier studies have implicated numerous genes related to neurotransmission, immune function, and stress response – for instance polymorphisms in serotonin transporters (SLC6A4), catecholamine metabolism (COMT), HPA axis regulators, cytokines like TNF-α and IFN-γ, and others ([
            Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): An Overview - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538807/#:~:text=%2A%20COMT%20%28catechol)) ([
            Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): An Overview - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538807/#:~:text=Carlo,54%20CFS)). Each of these variants exerts a small influence, and different patients have different combinations, underscoring that **predisposition is not one-dimensional**. Likewise, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos (hEDS) has a complex genetic basis – often polygenic, involving connective tissue genes such as *TNXB* (tenascin) and possibly the RCCX gene cluster on chromosome 6 – rather than a single mutation ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=match%20at%20L391%20stress%20response,C4%29%2C%20and%20stress)). Even POTS and MCAS have been linked to various immune-related genes and autoimmunity, rather than a uniform inherited factor. 

Beyond DNA sequence, **epigenetic and developmental factors** further complicate “predisposition.” Severe or chronic stress can induce long-lasting epigenetic changes (e.g. DNA methylation patterns) that alter gene expression in immune and neuroendocrine pathways ([[PDF] Advocating the role of trained immunity in the pathogenesis of ME/CFS](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1483764/pdf#:~:text=,and%20results%20in%20a)). For instance, patients with ME/CFS show distinctive DNA methylation changes in immune cell genes and metabolic regulators ([Epigenetic reprograming in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38693641/#:~:text=,physiology%20associated%20with%20immune%20responses)), and some changes correlate with disease severity. These findings point to a **“trained” or reprogrammed physiology** – potentially via early life stress or infections – that cannot be captured by a static scalar γ. In summary, the model’s γ parameter is too crude. It fails to reflect the **polygenic risk scores, gene–gene interactions, and epigenetic modifications** that modern studies associate with CMSSs. We suggest that any refined model treat genetic predisposition as a vector or landscape of vulnerabilities – for example, incorporating subsets for connective tissue integrity, immune regulation (HLA haplotypes, cytokine genes), autonomic receptor sensitivity, and so on, each weighted by evidence from genomics. This would align the model with the reality that **genetic risk is distributed across many loci and modulated by environment**, rather than a single inherent “fragility.” ([Multi-ancestry GWAS of Long COVID identifies immune-related loci and etiological links to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and depression | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.07.24315052v1#:~:text=fatigue%20%28Mendelian%20randomization%20OR%3D1.59%2C%2095,These%20findings%20can%20help)) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538807/#:~:text=%2A%20COMT%20%28catechol))

### 2. Allostatic Load (Λ) – Quantification Challenges and Multi-System Stress  
The concept of **allostatic load (Λ)** in GASLIT-AF is compelling: it represents the cumulative “wear and tear” of life stressors on the body’s systems, which can push an at-risk individual toward the pathological attractor. However, the model provides no clear method to quantify Λ, and treating it as a single numeric threshold belies the complexity of measuring chronic stress burden. In research, allostatic load is typically assessed by a composite index of various biomarkers – e.g. stress hormone levels, immune/inflammatory markers, metabolic indicators, blood pressure, etc. – rather than a direct observable quantity. For example, one study defined a high allostatic load index in CFS patients using a combination of elevated overnight cortisol, altered blood pressure, cholesterol, waist-to-hip ratio, and other risk factors ([A systematic review and meta-analysis of urinary biomarkers in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) | Journal of Translational Medicine | Full Text](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-023-04295-0#:~:text=Maloney%20et%20al,was%20not%20reported%20by%20Maloney)). In fact, **CFS patients were found to be nearly twice as likely to have high allostatic load scores as healthy controls** ([A systematic review and meta-analysis of urinary biomarkers in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) | Journal of Translational Medicine | Full Text](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-023-04295-0#:~:text=Maloney%20et%20al,was%20not%20reported%20by%20Maloney)). Maloney et al. (2006) showed that ME/CFS patients had significantly higher allostatic load indices than controls, and interestingly identified **urinary cortisol output as a key component** that discriminated patients from healthy individuals ([A systematic review and meta-analysis of urinary biomarkers in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) | Journal of Translational Medicine | Full Text](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-023-04295-0#:~:text=Maloney%20et%20al,was%20not%20reported%20by%20Maloney)). This suggests chronic dysregulation of the HPA axis contributes substantially to total allostatic burden in these patients. More recent analyses reinforce that chronic fatigue syndromes often show blunted or deficient cortisol (especially a flat diurnal cortisol curve), consistent with a state of **“HPA axis exhaustion”** from chronic stress exposure ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=various%20immune%20perturbations%20were%20present,basis%20of%20the%20Long%20COVID)) ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=acute%20infection%2C%20the%20plasma%20cortisol,predictor%20for%20Long%20COVID%20classification)). In other words, years of stress may lead to inadequate cortisol responses (a form of allostatic overload), which then fails to protect the body from inflammation and instability.

Quantifying Λ is thus inherently **multidimensional** – it is the aggregate of **psychosocial stress, recurrent infections, physical exertional stress, toxic exposures, etc., and the physiological strain they produce**. The GASLIT-AF model in its current form does not indicate how one would measure Λ in a given patient (e.g. via biomarkers or clinical history). This is a critical omission for a model aiming to guide diagnosis or treatment. Moreover, different types of stress may weigh differently: for example, infectious triggers (mononucleosis, COVID-19) can impose a sudden acute allostatic load via immune activation and tissue damage, whereas years of childhood trauma or overtraining might create a gradual metabolic and neuroendocrine strain. Both types are implicated in CMSSs. Indeed, a history of adverse events and chronic stressors is common in fibromyalgia and ME/CFS patients, pointing to cumulative **“hit after hit”** effects on the neuroimmune system ([Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](https://accesspharmacy.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=3095&sectionid=265450021#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20infectious%20insults%2C,have)). Therefore, **Λ should be conceived as a vector or a composite index** capturing multiple domains of stress load. Recent work in psychoneuroimmunology recommends monitoring markers like cortisol (HPA axis), DHEA, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα), oxidative stress levels, autonomic tone (heart rate variability), and even lifestyle factors to gauge total allostatic load ([The role of the hippocampus in the pathogenesis of Myalgic ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987715004478#:~:text=%E2%80%9Callostatic%20overload%E2%80%9D%20%28see%20,to%20a%20degree%20that)). A refined model could incorporate an **allostatic load sub-model**, summing contributions from these varied stress domains. For instance, *f*(γ, Λ) in the model might be expanded so that Λ = Λ<sub>endocrine</sub> + Λ<sub>immune</sub> + Λ<sub>autonomic</sub> + Λ<sub>metabolic</sub>, etc., each measured by relevant indicators. This would improve realism and allow researchers to actually estimate how “loaded” a patient’s system is. The insight that **allostatic load “erodes the body’s resilience” over time ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=and%20experiential%20factors%20that%20can,is%20a%20complex%20network%20of))** is sound ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=and%20experiential%20factors%20that%20can,is%20a%20complex%20network%20of)), but without concrete metrics the model cannot be empirically tested or applied. The recent longitudinal studies of post-COVID patients, for example, show that those who develop Long COVID have persistent aberrations like **low cortisol, elevated IL-6, IL-8, and autoantibodies months after infection** ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=analysis%20involving%20215%20individuals%20showed,reporting%20dramatically%20worsened%20quality%20of)) ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=COVID%20compared%20to%20controls,10)) – essentially evidence of sustained allostatic overload after the acute phase. The model should leverage such data, treating those measures as part of Λ. In summary, **allostatic load must be operationalized** in GASLIT-AF: it should be defined via quantifiable biomarkers and life stress inventories, and recognized as a multi-system construct rather than a single number on a dial.

### 3. Buffering Capacity (Ω) – Overemphasis on the Endocannabinoid System  
One of the most novel aspects of GASLIT-AF is the introduction of a “buffering capacity” Ω that represents the body’s ability to absorb stress perturbations and maintain homeostasis. The model heavily attributes this buffering to the **endocannabinoid system (ECS)**, suggesting that a deficient ECS (low endocannabinoid tone or receptor function) is a major driver of collapse into the disease state ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=state%20characteristic%20of%20these%20illnesses,CNR1%2C%20which%20encodes%20the%20CB1)) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=genetic%20vulnerabilities%20,A%20compromised%20ECS%20might)). While the ECS *is* indeed an important modulatory system – involved in pain regulation, mood, appetite, immune modulation, and stress responses – the model’s exclusive focus on it as the buffering reservoir is too narrow. In reality, **multiple overlapping systems buffer stress and maintain stability**: the parasympathetic nervous system (vagus nerve activity), the HPA axis (cortisol release), antioxidant and metabolic reserves, and others all contribute to resilience. Recent research on Long COVID underscores this point. A 2024 hypothesis paper identified **three main anti-inflammatory reflex mechanisms** that normally terminate stress/inflammation: (1) the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, (2) the HPA axis cortisol response, and (3) mitochondrial redox regulation (antioxidant defenses) ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=functional%20damage%20to%20the%20main,inconsistent%20due%20to%20reduced%20vagal)) ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=tone%20and%20direct%20damage%20to,in%20people%20who%20develop%20LC)). The authors propose that Long COVID persists when **all three buffering systems are impaired** – i.e. vagal tone is reduced, the HPA axis is suppressed (low cortisol), and cells cannot adequately neutralize oxidative stress ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=functional%20damage%20to%20the%20main,inconsistent%20due%20to%20reduced%20vagal)) ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=tone%20and%20direct%20damage%20to,in%20people%20who%20develop%20LC)). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 can damage each of these: it may injure vagal nerve fibers, directly affect adrenal glands and glucocorticoid receptors, and induce mitochondrial dysfunction ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=,cortisol%2C%20with%20its%20cytoplasmatic%20and)) ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=cellular%20receptors%20respectively%2C%20are%20fundamental,in%20its%20expression%20and%20function)). This paints a picture of a multi-pronged buffer failure. Indeed, a prominent finding in Long COVID is **marked hypocortisolism** (roughly 50% lower cortisol levels than in recovered or healthy individuals) ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=analysis%20involving%20215%20individuals%20showed,reporting%20dramatically%20worsened%20quality%20of)), with a paradoxical lack of compensatory ACTH increase indicating central adrenal axis suppression ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=match%20at%20L272%20COVID%20compared,10)). Such low cortisol is strongly predictive of long-term symptom severity ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=analysis%20involving%20215%20individuals%20showed,reporting%20dramatically%20worsened%20quality%20of)). This evidence suggests that **HPA axis buffering (cortisol output)** is a critical factor in post-viral syndromes – yet the GASLIT-AF model largely omits cortisol/HPA dynamics in favor of the ECS. 

Similarly, **vagal tone** (which can be indexed by heart rate variability) is often reduced in these chronic conditions. Low vagal activity is associated with elevated inflammation; for example, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and co-morbid IBS who have low vagal tone show higher TNF-α and epinephrine levels ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=axis%20and%20suggests%20that%20greater,Further%20supporting%20this%20finding%2C%20lower)) ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L840%20susceptibility%20to,vulnerable%20to%20developing%20LC%2C%20particularly)) – a sign that the autonomic brake on inflammation and stress is failing. In fibromyalgia, studies consistently find **decreased heart rate variability** (shift toward sympathetic dominance) compared to healthy controls ([Heart rate variability in patients with fibromyalgia and patients with ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248383489_Heart_rate_variability_in_patients_with_fibromyalgia_and_patients_with_chronic_fatigue_syndrome_A_systematic_review#:~:text=,rate%20variability%20and%20blunted)). Reduced HRV is also documented in post-COVID survivors with fatigue ([Heart rate variability is reduced in COVID‐19 survivors and ...](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.14814/phy2.15912#:~:text=Heart%20rate%20variability%20is%20reduced,PA)). Augmenting vagal activity via **vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)** has shown therapeutic promise: a pilot trial in 2024 applied daily transcutaneous VNS to Long COVID patients and observed significant improvements in symptoms – including better cognitive function, reduced anxiety/depression, improved sleep, and gradual reduction in fatigue ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11097097/#:~:text=observed%20significant%20improvements%20across%20cognitive,up%2C%20eventually%20reaching%20significance.%20Similarly)). These benefits emerged over 10 days of stimulation and persisted at 1-month follow-up ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11097097/#:~:text=observed%20significant%20improvements%20across%20cognitive,up%2C%20eventually%20reaching%20significance.%20Similarly)). Such results highlight that **enhancing parasympathetic (vagal) buffering can ameliorate the chronic syndrome state**, which is something the current model’s Ω (if only equated with ECS) would not predict or account for. 

The **endocannabinoid system** itself does have intriguing links to these conditions. The theory of **Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency (CECD)** posits that some chronic disorders (migraine, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, etc.) may involve inherently low endocannabinoid levels or receptor function ([Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Fibromyalgia](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/47/4/230#:~:text=The%20notion%20that%20fibromyalgia%20might,CECD)) ([Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Fibromyalgia](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/47/4/230#:~:text=95,Google%20Scholar)). For fibromyalgia specifically, researchers have found that anandamide (an endocannabinoid) levels can be dysregulated, and case reports indicate some patients respond to cannabinoid therapies ([Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Fibromyalgia](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/47/4/230#:~:text=The%20notion%20that%20fibromyalgia%20might,CECD)).

So, the ECS is indeed a piece of the puzzle; a compromised ECS might reduce one’s ability to “dampen down” pain, anxiety, and inflammation ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=match%20at%20L448%20ability%20of,function%2C%20or%20manage%20the%20physiological)) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=The%20proposed%20role%20of%20the,therefore%20contribute%20to%20the%20varying)). However, **framing Ω solely as ECS capacity is an overemphasis** that ignores other critical buffers. A person with perfectly normal endocannabinoid tone but extremely low cortisol and vagal tone could still develop a CMSS, and vice versa. In practice, many patients with these syndromes show signs of *widespread buffering deficits*: for instance, a fibromyalgia patient may have low HRV, blunted cortisol awakening response, and sleep disturbances (indicating poor homeostatic sleep-drive), in addition to any endocannabinoid issues. 

We recommend broadening Ω to represent **overall physiological resiliency**, encompassing **neuroendocrine, autonomic, metabolic, and ECS buffering**. This could be modeled as a composite function – e.g., Ω = f(ECS tone, vagal tone, HPA reserve, redox capacity, etc.). Empirical proxies can be used: resting vagal tone via HRV, cortisol dynamics via saliva cortisol curve, ECS tone via plasma endocannabinoid levels or genetic proxies, antioxidant buffering via glutathione levels or oxidative stress markers. By incorporating these, the model would align with evidence that **loss of multi-system resilience is what permits a transient stress to precipitate long-term illness**. In short, the ECS should be one part of Ω, not the whole. The current model’s heavy focus on cannabinoid genes/receptors ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=receptor%20type%201%20,receptor%20and%20potentially%20contribute%20to)) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=%28ECS%29%20,genetic%20variations%20linked%20to)) is interesting and perhaps novel in the context of these syndromes, but it should not eclipse the wealth of data implicating vagal/HPA dysfunction. Integrating all these will yield a more balanced understanding of “the straw that breaks the camel’s back” – i.e., which buffering system failing is most critical for a given patient.

### 4. Entropy Production (σ) and Coherence (C) – Vague Definitions and Measurement  
GASLIT-AF borrows terms from thermodynamics and complexity science, positing that the diseased state is characterized by **high entropy production (σ)** and **low coherence (C)** in physiological networks ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=CMSSs%20represent%20a%20distinct%20pathological,AF%20model%2C%20exploring%20its%20foundational)) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=the%20state%20of%20a%20system,coordination%20that%20characterizes%20healthy%20physiology)). While evocative, these terms are not rigorously defined in the model, making them difficult to interpret or validate. **What exactly is “entropy” in a biological context here?** Is it metabolic entropy (dissipation of energy as heat), informational entropy (randomness in physiological signals), or entropy of a probability distribution of states? Likewise, “coherence” could refer to phase synchrony between oscillating processes (e.g. heart and breath rhythms), coordination among organ systems, or stability of network connections. The lack of clarity risks σ and C being seen as buzzwords rather than useful quantities. 

From a dynamical systems perspective, one might expect an illness attractor state to show **reduced complexity and adaptability**. Counterintuitively, the model says “high entropy, low coherence.” Many real-world observations suggest that these chronic conditions involve a *loss* of complexity in certain physiological patterns – effectively a more constrained, rigid state rather than a freely chaotic one. For example, patients with CFS show **reduced variability in their activity levels and physiological rhythms**. A study analyzing 12-day actigraphy (physical activity patterns) in CFS found a significant **reduction in entropy and fractal complexity** of activity compared to healthy controls ([Reduced complexity of activity patterns in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: a case control study | BioPsychoSocial Medicine | Full Text](https://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0759-3-7#:~:text=Results)). Specifically, the entropy (Renyi entropy) of their activity time-series was lower, indicating more regular, stereotyped patterns, and their fractal dimension was lower, indicating less multiscale complexity ([Reduced complexity of activity patterns in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: a case control study | BioPsychoSocial Medicine | Full Text](https://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0759-3-7#:~:text=CFS%20cases%20showed%20reduced%20complexity,after%20adjustment%20for%20total%20activity)). This “loss of complexity” paradigm is also seen in aging and other chronic diseases – healthy systems typically exhibit rich variability, whereas sick or fatigued systems can get “stuck” in narrow activity ranges ([Reduced complexity of activity patterns in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: a case control study | BioPsychoSocial Medicine | Full Text](https://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0759-3-7#:~:text=data%20can%20be%20used%20to,complexity%20compared%20to%20healthy%20controls)) ([Reduced complexity of activity patterns in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: a case control study | BioPsychoSocial Medicine | Full Text](https://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0759-3-7#:~:text=CFS%20cases%20showed%20reduced%20complexity,after%20adjustment%20for%20total%20activity)). Similarly, **heart rate variability (HRV)**, which can be thought of as a measure of system entropy and complexity in the cardiac autonomic signal, is often **diminished** in fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, and post-COVID patients ([Heart rate variability in patients with fibromyalgia and patients with ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248383489_Heart_rate_variability_in_patients_with_fibromyalgia_and_patients_with_chronic_fatigue_syndrome_A_systematic_review#:~:text=,rate%20variability%20and%20blunted)) ([Heart rate variability is reduced in COVID‐19 survivors and ...](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.14814/phy2.15912#:~:text=Heart%20rate%20variability%20is%20reduced,PA)). Diminished HRV means the heart rhythm is more regular and less responsive to stimuli (lower complexity), which correlates with poor health outcomes. These findings seem at odds with a blanket statement of “high entropy”. 

What the model likely intends by “high entropy production” is that the pathological state is thermodynamically costly and disordered – perhaps manifesting as wasted energy (e.g. heat, inefficient metabolism) and chaotic fluctuations in some variables. It is true that many CMSS patients have signs of metabolic inefficiency (e.g. **elevated resting lactate, low ATP production, high oxidative stress**), which could be seen as a kind of increased internal entropy. For instance, after exercise, ME/CFS patients accumulate more lactate and take longer to recover metabolic homeostasis than controls ([Redox imbalance links COVID-19 and myalgic encephalomyelitis ...](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024358118#:~:text=,levels%20after%20exercise%20as)), suggesting their system is less efficient and dissipates more energy (consistent with high entropy production in a thermodynamic sense). And “low coherence” likely refers to the lack of coordination between systems – e.g. the immune system firing off without effective endocrine regulation, or circadian rhythms desynchronized. Indeed, one study found that **serum from ME/CFS patients can disrupt cellular circadian rhythms, reducing the coherence of those oscillations over time** ([Serum from Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165572823001285#:~:text=Serum%20from%20Myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic%20fatigue,coherence%20of%20rhythms%20over%20time)). This implies an *in vivo* loss of coherence in biochemical oscillators, which could relate to symptoms like unrefreshing sleep and hormone timing disruptions common in these illnesses. Brain network studies have also shown **altered connectivity/coherence** in CFS – for example, EEG coherence analyses can distinguish CFS patients from healthy controls, pointing to abnormal communication between brain regions in patients ([EEG spectral coherence data distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3146818/#:~:text=EEG%20spectral%20coherence%20data%20distinguish,misclassifying%20depressed%20patients%20as%20CFS)). In fibromyalgia, reduced alpha-wave connectivity and other EEG changes have been reported, again reflecting aberrant network coherence in the CNS. 

Given these nuances, the critique is that **σ and C in the model are too vaguely defined to be actionable**. We don’t know if a “high σ, low C” state would be detected by measuring, say, HRV or fMRI connectivity or metabolic flux. To refine this, the modelers should specify what proxies correspond to entropy and coherence. For instance: **Define coherence (C)** as a measurable index of cross-system coordination – perhaps the **cross-correlation of key physiological rhythms** (heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol diurnal cycle, body temperature cycle, etc.), or metrics like “physiological network connectivity.” One could create a network graph of organ systems (nodes) with weighted edges for the strength of feedback between them; a healthy state might show strong, appropriately timed couplings (high coherence), whereas in CMSS these couplings break down (edges lost). Some researchers use the term “network coherence” to describe integrated function – e.g., the heart-brain communication in healthy homeostasis versus dysautonomia. Coherence could also be defined via **frequency domain analyses** – for example, how well heart rate variations are synchronized with respiratory cycles (respiratory sinus arrhythmia coherence), or how coherent the immune-inflammatory cycles are with circadian clocks. These can be tested. **Define entropy (σ)** in a way relevant to physiology – for example, use **multiscale entropy** or **approximate entropy** on time-series data (heart rate, activity levels, cytokine fluctuations). Or interpret σ as **entropy production rate in metabolism**, which might be inferred from measures of inefficiency (heat dissipation, elevated resting VO₂, etc.). If the model posits a “high entropy” state, one could look for signs like highly irregular fluctuations in symptom severity or autonomic signals. Interestingly, some data show increased short-term variability in symptoms (random crashes) but decreased complexity in underlying regulatory signals (like a stuck thermostat with occasional extreme swings). 

In summary, there is a need to **clarify and operationalize σ and C**. As it stands, “low coherence, high entropy” is conceptually plausible but empirically nebulous. The model should guide us: e.g., “we expect CMSS patients to have lower inter-system coherence – measurable as X – and higher internal entropy – measurable as Y.” Without this, these terms risk being metaphors. Recent work in systems medicine suggests treating health as a state of “critical complexity” – too little variability is bad (rigidity), too much is bad (chaos); disease can be either loss of complexity or uncontrolled complexity ([Reduced complexity of activity patterns in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: a case control study | BioPsychoSocial Medicine | Full Text](https://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0759-3-7#:~:text=data%20can%20be%20used%20to,complexity%20compared%20to%20healthy%20controls)) ([Reduced complexity of activity patterns in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: a case control study | BioPsychoSocial Medicine | Full Text](https://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0759-3-7#:~:text=CFS%20cases%20showed%20reduced%20complexity,after%20adjustment%20for%20total%20activity)). It may be that early-stage stress leads to chaotic fluctuations (high entropy) but chronic illness ends in a partially collapsed, rigid state (low complexity). The model should reconcile this or specify the timescale: perhaps during the transition to the attractor, entropy spikes, but once in the attractor, certain measures of complexity are actually reduced. This kind of detailed dynamic description would greatly strengthen GASLIT-AF’s explanatory power. For now, the **vagueness of σ and C** is a notable weakness – but one that can be addressed by incorporating metrics from chaos theory and physiology (e.g., Lyapunov exponents for dynamical stability, network synchrony measures, etc.). Clear definitions would also allow testing: e.g., if the model predicts high σ, do we observe more erratic variability in some biomarkers of patients vs. controls? These are testable hypotheses if σ, C are defined quantitatively.

### 5. Poor Differentiation Between CMSS Phenotypes  
The GASLIT-AF model explicitly seeks to provide a *unifying* explanation for a spectrum of conditions – which is laudable given their overlap (many patients indeed carry multiple diagnoses) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=following%20various%20triggers,This)). However, in unifying, the model currently **glosses over important differences in phenotypic expression** between syndromes. ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, POTS, hEDS, MCAS, and Long COVID do share common themes (fatigue, brain fog, autonomic dysfunction, etc.), but they also have distinguishing features and presumably some distinct pathological pathways. The model largely treats them as one and the same “pathological attractor” with no clear mechanism for why one person’s attractor manifests more as orthostatic tachycardia (POTS) whereas another’s manifests as mast cell flares (MCAS). In reality, we know: 

- **ME/CFS** is defined by *post-exertional malaise* – a drastic exacerbation of symptoms after minor exertion, often delayed by 24–48 hours ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=,Various)). This unique feature implies something about energy metabolism and post-exercise molecular events (e.g. impaired recovery of homeostasis after exertion, possibly distinct from fibromyalgia). 
- **Fibromyalgia** is characterized by chronic widespread pain and hyperalgesia, with diagnostic tender points. It is often considered a central sensitization syndrome – aberrant pain processing in the CNS. While fatigue and poor sleep are common in FM, not all fibro patients meet ME/CFS criteria (post-exertional crash is less universal). FM also has higher prevalence in women and certain psychosocial correlations, suggesting its attractor might lie more in the CNS pain modulation network.
- **POTS** is specifically defined by excessive heart rate increase upon standing (≥30 bpm) with orthostatic intolerance symptoms. While many POTS patients have fatigue, POTS is fundamentally an autonomic cardiovascular disorder; some POTS patients do not have severe pain or immune issues of the sort seen in fibromyalgia/MCAS. There are subtypes of POTS (neuropathic, hyperadrenergic, etc.) often involving peripheral denervation or autoantibodies to autonomic receptors ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Multiple%20studies%20have%20found%20elevated,High%20levels%20of)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=match%20at%20L539%20adrenergic%20receptor,of%20a)).
- **hEDS** (hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos) is a heritable connective tissue disorder leading to joint hypermobility, tissue fragility, and often dysautonomia and pain. The presence of true connective tissue weakness (collagen defects) sets it apart: these patients physically injure joints easily and may have spinal instability – a mechanical aspect not explained by pure network collapse. Yet hEDS patients commonly have POTS and mast cell issues, so they inhabit a similar “space” but likely due to structural tissue gene differences (e.g. *TNXB* mutations) ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=stress%20response%20and%20anxiety%20%2C,C4%29%2C%20and%20stress)).
- **MCAS** involves episodic release of mast cell mediators causing rashes, flushing, tachycardia, GI distress, etc. It’s an immunological syndrome, sometimes secondary to other conditions. Not all ME/CFS or fibromyalgia patients have MCAS; those who do might have more allergic/inflammatory symptoms. The attractor for MCAS could be thought of as an immune system attractor (mast cells stuck in hyper-reactivity). 
- **Long COVID (PASC)** is a broad category that likely encompasses patients who meet ME/CFS criteria post-viral, patients with new-onset POTS, patients with organ damage from acute COVID, etc. Long COVID has subphenotypes – e.g. some primarily respiratory, some primarily fatigue/neurocognitive ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=There%20are%20likely%20multiple%2C%20potentially,microvascular%20blood%20clotting%20with%20endothelial)). Notably, a subset of Long COVID patients fulfill ME/CFS and/or dysautonomia (POTS) definitions ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=stroke%2C%20as%20studied%20with%20use,diabetes9%20%2C%20cardiovascular%20outcomes%2036)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=There%20are%20likely%20multiple%2C%20potentially,microvascular%20blood%20clotting%20with%20endothelial)), essentially placing them in those attractor states, but others might have more endothelial or coagulation issues (microclots).

By treating all these as one state, GASLIT-AF runs the risk of being **too generic and not accurately predictive for any single condition**. It doesn’t address, for instance, why some people get predominantly pain vs. predominantly orthostatic intolerance. One clue from recent research is that there may be **endophenotypes** or clusters within the broad chronic illness umbrella. For example, a 2022 review noted that **connective tissue disorders (like EDS) and hypermobility are overrepresented in Long COVID patients** ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=many%20questions%20remain%20and%20are,has%20been%20reported%20in%20certain)), hinting that those with a certain “matrix” phenotype (structural tissue laxity) might develop more POTS/MCAS when hit by COVID – different from someone whose risk is mediated by, say, pre-existing autoimmunity or metabolic disease. The same review also suggests multiple *parallel* mechanisms for long COVID: some patients might have viral persistence in tissues, others autoimmunity, others dysautonomia, or all of the above ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=There%20are%20likely%20multiple%2C%20potentially,microvascular%20blood%20clotting%20with%20endothelial)). A single attractor model might need different basins for these. 

The high co-morbidity rates do argue for a shared mechanism (which is the motivation for GASLIT-AF). Indeed, it is striking that one person can fulfill **multiple** diagnoses – e.g. one patient could simultaneously have hEDS, POTS, MCAS, ME/CFS and fibromyalgia. This suggests these are not completely independent diseases but interconnected manifestations that can blend. A unified model is thus worth pursuing, but it must allow for **diverse presentations**. Perhaps the best way to refine the model is to consider that the chronic illness “landscape” has **multiple pathological attractor states that are adjacent or overlapping in the state-space**. In other words, there may be a family of related attractors – one slightly more immune-focused (MCAS-like), one more autonomic-focused (POTS-like), one more CNS energy-focused (ME/CFS-like), etc. Patients might slide between them or occupy a state that combines features of several. The model could represent this by having the state-space Ψ (with many dimensions: autonomic parameters, immune parameters, metabolic parameters, etc.) contain a **“pathological basin of attraction” that is broad and has multiple local minima corresponding to phenotypic variants**. Small differences in initial conditions or parameter emphasis could determine which minima a patient ends up in. For instance, if one patient has a specific autoantibody (e.g. anti-β₂ adrenergic receptor) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Multiple%20studies%20have%20found%20elevated,High%20levels%20of)), their trajectory might land in a more POTS/dysautonomia sub-attractor; another with high systemic inflammation might land in a more fatigue/inflammatory sub-attractor.

Concrete evidence of differential pathways: **Autoantibodies** have been found in a significant subset of both POTS and Long COVID patients – particularly antibodies against G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like adrenergic and muscarinic receptors ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Multiple%20studies%20have%20found%20elevated,High%20levels%20of)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=match%20at%20L539%20adrenergic%20receptor,of%20a)). These can drive autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, vasodilation) and are likely more relevant in those whose syndrome features orthostatic issues. Meanwhile, other Long COVID patients show signs of viral persistence (spike protein or RNA lingering) or latent virus reactivations (EBV, HHV-6) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=persisting%20reservoirs%20of%20SARS,Mechanistic%20studies)), which might lead to a phenotype more dominated by immune symptoms and fatigue. **Fibromyalgia** often has a distinct lack of major inflammation (normal CRP, etc.) but heightened pain neurotransmission; some recent studies even found **small-fiber neuropathy** in about half of fibromyalgia patients, linking it to nerve damage/pain loops (an aspect less prominent in pure ME/CFS). So, while the model can unify the idea of a stable dysfunction state, it needs to account for **parameter heterogeneity**: not every parameter (γ, Λ, Ω, etc.) contributes equally in all patients. For example, one could refine γ to include *which* genetic vulnerabilities: an hEDS patient’s γ might be high in connective tissue fragility genes; a fibromyalgia patient’s γ might be high in pain modulation genes (e.g. COMT mutations affecting dopamine and epinephrine, which have indeed been associated with pain sensitivity ([
            Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): An Overview - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538807/#:~:text=%2A%20COMT%20%28catechol))); an MCAS patient’s γ might involve mast cell receptor variants. The model currently lumps all as “genetic vulnerability” without nuance. Similarly, triggers and feedback loops might differ. The **lack of specificity** here means the model cannot yet explain why, say, treating mast cells (H₁/H₂ blockers, cromolyn) helps some patients (implying mast cell activation was central for them) while others benefit more from beta-blockers or pyridostigmine (implying autonomic excess was central). 

In summary, **GASLIT-AF needs to differentiate the CMSS phenotypes by allowing customizable parameter sets or sub-models for each condition, within the larger attractor framework.** The conditions are “siblings” but not identical twins. A refined model might have, for instance, additional parameters or weighting factors that determine the dominance of certain subsystems: e.g. a parameter for “autoimmune tendency” (e.g. presence of specific autoantibodies), a parameter for “connective tissue integrity,” etc. These could tilt the system into one manifestation or another. Without this, the model risks being too one-size-fits-all. As a result, it could **overlook targeted interventions** – for example, it might suggest ECS-based treatments uniformly, whereas perhaps only a subset (those with true CECD) would benefit, and others might need immunotherapy or mechanical stabilization of cervical spine (for those with craniocervical instability in hEDS). By explicitly modeling phenotype-specific loops (see next section) and acknowledging heterogeneity, GASLIT-AF can maintain its unifying vision while not ignoring that **each CMSS has unique hallmarks that any theory must account for**.

### 6. Lack of Specificity in Feedback Loop Mechanisms  
The model attributes the stable pathological state to “recursive stress–response loops” and a collapse of normal regulatory feedback, but it speaks in generalities and does not detail *which* feedback loops are implicated ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=production%20and%20low%20physiological%20coherence,these%20conditions%20strongly%20suggests%20shared)). In complex physiology, there are numerous interconnected feedback circuits maintaining homeostasis. A failure in any of these could potentially contribute to a chronic disorder. By not specifying, GASLIT-AF provides little guidance on *where* to look for dysregulation or *which* loops to target therapeutically. We have considerable knowledge from prior research about specific dysfunctional feedback mechanisms in these syndromes:

- **Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Feedback:** Normally, cortisol released in response to stress feeds back to suppress excessive inflammation and pituitary/adrenal activity (a negative feedback loop). In many CMSS patients, this loop appears blunted. As mentioned, Long COVID and ME/CFS patients often have **low cortisol** despite ongoing illness stress ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=various%20immune%20perturbations%20were%20present,basis%20of%20the%20Long%20COVID)) ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=acute%20infection%2C%20the%20plasma%20cortisol,predictor%20for%20Long%20COVID%20classification)). Yavropoulou et al. note that in Long COVID there is a “lack of HPA axis response to hypocortisolism” – essentially the axis is stuck in a suppressed state and not reacting to low cortisol with higher ACTH ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=match%20at%20L272%20COVID%20compared,10)). This suggests a broken negative feedback: the brain is not sensing or correcting the cortisol deficit (possibly due to epigenetic changes or receptor insensitivity from prolonged stress) ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=modulating%20mitochondrial%20function%2C%20which%20is,in%20its%20expression%20and%20function)). Such a loop failure can lead to an inability to restrain inflammation (since cortisol is a major anti-inflammatory). Indeed, persistent immune activation is seen in these illnesses (e.g. slightly elevated cytokines, autoimmunity) that normally cortisol would help resolve. The GASLIT-AF model should incorporate an HPA axis module – for instance, representing cortisol output as a dynamic variable that normally damps immune activation, and examining how chronic stress or genetic factors could create a new equilibrium of low cortisol/high inflammation. Some have proposed that **adrenal feedback failure** is central to post-stressor syndromes, essentially trapping the body in a low-cortisol attractor ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic%20fatigue%20syndrome%2C%20post,associated%20clinical%20and%20immunological%20manifestations)). Empirically, trials with very low-dose hydrocortisone in chronic fatigue have shown mild benefits, consistent with the idea that boosting this loop a bit helps (though long-term steroids are not viable due to adrenal suppression). This loop’s dysfunction is critical to specify.

- **Autonomic Feedback (Baroreflex and Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Reflex):** The autonomic nervous system maintains stability through mechanisms like the **baroreflex** (which adjusts heart rate and vascular tone in response to blood pressure changes) and the **vagal anti-inflammatory reflex** (vagus nerve stimulation of acetylcholine release can inhibit macrophages and cytokine release). In POTS and related dysautonomia, the baroreflex often doesn’t function adequately – patients standing up experience tachycardia and low blood pressure, but the usual vasoconstriction reflex is delayed or insufficient. This could be due to peripheral neuropathy (loss of baroreceptor signal) or central dysregulation. Additionally, the **balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic** output is off; usually, sympathetic surges are tempered by parasympathetic return to baseline, but in these patients sympathetic activity can dominate unchecked. One could view POTS as a state where the cardiovascular control loop is running open-loop or with a wrong setpoint. Autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors in POTS patients provide one mechanism: they effectively “jam” the feedback by activating receptors or impairing baroreflex sensitivity ([Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome Associated with COVID-19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11356245/#:~:text=COVID,generated%20to%20provoke%20an)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=match%20at%20L539%20adrenergic%20receptor,of%20a)). The GASLIT-AF model mentions “autonomic structural instability” in its name, but doesn’t detail how feedback fails. A refinement would be to include an **autonomic circuit**: e.g., blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) with a feedback law modeling baroreflex; then show how high Λ or low Ω could reduce baroreflex gain (for instance via vagal impairment), causing instability (tachycardia, poor perfusion). Similarly, incorporate the **cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway** as a feedback: normally, high inflammation triggers vagal signals that suppress cytokine release. If vagal Ω is low (as in low coherence state), this feedback fails, leading to runaway inflammation after triggers. 

- **Immune System and Inflammatory Feedback:** In acute infections, pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger anti-inflammatory counter-signals, and the immune response is usually self-limited (via regulatory T cells, cortisol, etc.). In CMSS patients, there is evidence of a smoldering inflammatory activation that doesn’t fully shut off. For example, some Long COVID and ME/CFS patients have elevated cytokines like IL-6, IL-8, or interferon gamma long after the trigger ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=analysis%20involving%20215%20individuals%20showed,reporting%20dramatically%20worsened%20quality%20of)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=adrenergic%20receptor%20and%20muscarinic%20acetylcholine,of%20a)). One theory is that a **positive feedback loop involving microglial activation in the brain** perpetuates symptoms: inflammatory signals (like HMGB1, or IL-1) activate microglia, which release more cytokines and neuroexcitatory substances, further activating the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system, which in a maladapted state, fails to suppress the inflammation, instead potentially exacerbating it (through norepinephrine’s effects on immune cells). Mackay (2021) specifically hypothesizes that in post-COVID/ME/CFS, the **hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN)** – a key stress integration center – becomes hyper-sensitized and inflamed by microglia, leading to a vicious cycle of neuroinflammation and autonomic dysfunction ([Frontiers | A Paradigm for Post-Covid-19 Fatigue Syndrome Analogous to ME/CFS](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.701419/full#:~:text=hypothalamic%20paraventricular%20nucleus%20%28PVN%29,ME%2FCFS%2C%20that%20perpetuate%20an%20ongoing)) ([Frontiers | A Paradigm for Post-Covid-19 Fatigue Syndrome Analogous to ME/CFS](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.701419/full#:~:text=hypothalamic%20PVN%20can%20become%20an,19%20Fatigue%20Syndrome)). In this model, the PVN is an example of a node where multiple feedback loops intersect (receiving signals from immune system, sending out cortisol and autonomic outputs). If the PVN’s regulation is broken by inflammation, you get a cascade of systemic effects. The GASLIT-AF framework would benefit from identifying such loci of dysregulation: e.g. *the PVN loop* (crosstalk between brain inflammation and systemic stress response) as a concrete mechanism. Evidence for this includes imaging studies (some ME/CFS patients show neuroinflammation on PET scans) and the symptom pattern of stress-triggered relapses (suggesting a central stress regulator dysfunction). Another immune feedback issue is **autoimmunity** – normally, immune tolerance (feedback that prevents attacking self) is maintained by regulatory immune cells. If that fails, autoantibodies or autoreactive T-cells can arise and then maintain a loop of tissue damage. POTS with adrenergic autoantibodies is an example: once formed, these autoantibodies can stimulate receptors chronically ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Multiple%20studies%20have%20found%20elevated,High%20levels%20of)), causing symptoms that further stress the body, potentially leading to more dysregulation. 

- **Metabolic/Energy Feedback:** Cells have feedback loops to maintain ATP levels (AMPK signaling, etc.) and to handle oxidative stress (NRF2 pathways, antioxidant production). In chronic fatigue states, there’s evidence these loops are not effectively compensating. For instance, when muscles in ME/CFS patients produce excess lactate, one would expect feedback to increase blood flow or mitochondrial biogenesis over time; instead, patients remain with poor oxygen utilization (perhaps due to impaired blood volume or mitochondrial impairment). A self-perpetuating loop proposed by some is the **“Redox trap” or “metabolic trap”** hypothesis – e.g., if a certain metabolic pathway (like the kynurenine/tryptophan pathway in IDO2 hypothesis) gets stuck in an aberrant state due to feedback failure, cells cannot revert to normal metabolism, keeping the patient in a low-energy state. Another example: **oxidative stress** can damage mitochondria, which in turn leads to more oxidative stress (vicious cycle). Indeed, oxidative stress markers are elevated in ME/CFS and Long COVID, and antioxidant capacity (e.g. glutathione) is often low ([Role of mitochondria, oxidative stress and the response to ...](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.11.002#:~:text=,inflammatory%20pathways%2C%20and%20brain%20dysfunction)) ([The significance of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of Long ...](https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/3050#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20oxidative%20stress,and%20Myalgic%20Encephalomyelitis%2FChronic%20Fatigue)). This hints that the normal feedback (whereby oxidative stress upregulates antioxidant responses via Nrf2, etc.) might be inadequate or compromised, allowing continued accumulation of reactive oxygen species that further impair mitochondria. The result is a stable dysfunction: the body stays in a state of high oxidative stress and low energy, which aligns with the attractor idea. 

The **common theme** across these loops is that normally the body has checks and balances (negative feedbacks) to restore equilibrium after stress, but in these syndromes the checks fail, or positive feedbacks dominate (vicious cycles). The GASLIT-AF model certainly endorses that concept qualitatively, but to be useful it should enumerate **which loops**. This would allow modelers to write down equations or rules for those loops and examine stability. For example, one could write a simplified set of differential equations for the interplay of cortisol, inflammation, and tissue damage and show there’s a stable high-inflammation/low-cortisol solution under certain parameter ranges (an attractor corresponding to chronic illness) ([Frontiers | A Paradigm for Post-Covid-19 Fatigue Syndrome Analogous to ME/CFS](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.701419/full#:~:text=hypothalamic%20paraventricular%20nucleus%20%28PVN%29,ME%2FCFS%2C%20that%20perpetuate%20an%20ongoing)) ([Frontiers | A Paradigm for Post-Covid-19 Fatigue Syndrome Analogous to ME/CFS](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.701419/full#:~:text=hypothalamic%20PVN%20can%20become%20an,19%20Fatigue%20Syndrome)). Without specifying loops, the model remains a black box (“some feedback fails, leading to bad state”). For clinicians and researchers, knowing the loops is crucial: it directs them to measure certain things (e.g. test for autoantibodies, measure cortisol, HRV, cytokines) and to pick interventions (e.g. if vagal feedback is weak, try vagus nerve stimulation; if mast cell feedback is an issue, use mast cell stabilizers; if autoantibodies, consider immunotherapy, etc.).

In sum, the critique is that **GASLIT-AF lacks mechanistic granularity**. It should be refined to explicitly include known dysregulated feedback loops: HPA axis (cortisol ↔ inflammation), autonomic circuits (baroreflex, vagal anti-inflammatory), immune self-regulation (autoimmunity, microglial activation, Treg failure), and metabolic control (mitochondrial function ↔ ROS). Each of these has empirical support in CMSS patients. By incorporating them, the model would not only explain “regulatory collapse” in concrete terms, but also enable predictions: e.g., if we boost loop X, can we push the system out of the attractor? As it stands, the model doesn’t guide such loop-specific interventions because it hasn’t delineated them. The refinement section below will suggest how to integrate these loops into a cohesive systems model and how to test them.

## Evidence for the Attractor State Hypothesis in Chronic Syndromes  
Despite the shortcomings above, the core premise of GASLIT-AF – that chronic multi-system syndromes represent **stable emergent states (attractors) in the body’s complex network** – finds considerable support in recent literature. Here we survey evidence from 2020–2025 that either **supports or challenges** this attractor hypothesis:

- **Persistent “State Shift” After Trigger:** One hallmark of an attractor is that once the system falls into it, it remains stable even after the initial trigger is gone. We see this in conditions like ME/CFS and Long COVID. Most Long COVID patients were healthy prior to a viral infection; something during the infection or convalescence pushed them into a chronic illness state that then self-perpetuates long after the virus is cleared (in many cases). For instance, in a UK post-hospitalization COVID study, **over 50% of patients had not recovered even at 1 year post-infection**, and their inflammatory markers (CRP, etc.) were often normal by then ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=In%20the%20%E2%80%9CPost,greater%20and%20prior%20invasive%20mechanical)) ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=headache%2C%20chest%20pain%2C%20abdominal%20symptoms%2C,4)). This suggests the ongoing symptoms are not simply due to lingering virus or organ damage; rather, a systems-level change has occurred. The National Academies of Sciences in 2023 defined Long COVID as “a chronic, systemic disease state” that can persist independently of the acute infection ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=Introduction)). They explicitly grouped it with ME/CFS and other post-infectious syndromes ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=Long%20COVID%20,A%20Long%20COVID%20Definition%3A%20A)), acknowledging that these may share a common pathophysiology. **Spontaneous remission is rare** in these conditions ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=those%20with%20mild%20to%20moderate,have%20been%20proposed%2C%20including%20persistent)) – most patients remain ill for months or years, which is consistent with being in a deep attractor basin that the system cannot easily escape on its own. This stability over time (with fluctuations but no return to baseline) is a key feature of an attractor. 

- **Relapse–Remission Dynamics and Thresholds:** Patients often describe a pattern where **stressors or overexertion cause severe relapse (crash)**, but partial recovery occurs with rest – though never back to full health. This is reminiscent of a system near a stability threshold: small perturbations are absorbed, but larger perturbations push the system to a worse equilibrium (a crash), from which it only partially comes back. ME/CFS’s post-exertional malaise is a prime example. Research shows that an exercise challenge can provoke abnormal responses lasting days: e.g., after a maximal exercise test on day 1, ME/CFS patients perform worse on day 2 (reduced VO₂max, impaired anaerobic threshold), whereas healthy people improve or repeat their performance ([Allostatic overload in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987713003137#:~:text=Allostatic%20overload%20in%20myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic,the%20physiological%20mechanisms%20employed)). This **inability to return to the previous state after a perturbation** is indicative of a different equilibrium. In some patients, a single severe stress (a major infection, trauma, etc.) is reported to have precipitated the syndrome and after that they “were never the same again” – suggesting a bifurcation point was crossed. Qualitative studies of patient narratives often mention *a point of no return*. This aligns with the concept of a **phase transition** in GASLIT-AF ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=the%20state%20of%20a%20system,coordination%20that%20characterizes%20healthy%20physiology)), where once a critical parameter exceeds a threshold, the system shifts to a new phase (healthy → chronic illness). Supporting this, **case reports** exist where patients recovered from ME/CFS after a major physiological upheaval (e.g., some women experience remission during pregnancy, or after another acute infection) – potentially indicating a forced exit from the attractor due to drastic system changes. These are anecdotal but intriguing as “reset” phenomena. Conversely, many treatments provide only temporary relief: they perturb the system but when removed, the patient often reverts to the ill state, as one would expect if the underlying attractor wasn’t abolished ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6709805/#:~:text=Schematic%20diagram%20of%20the%20conception,arrows%20to%20represent%20the%20dynamic)) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6709805/#:~:text=match%20at%20L218%20human%20body,The)). For example, some POTS patients manage symptoms with beta blockers or volume expanders, but if they stop, the tachycardia and presyncope return. In the context of drug discovery, it’s noted that complex diseases require therapies that **shift the system out of the disease attractor**, not just alleviate symptoms momentarily ([

This is why in autoimmune diseases, for instance, stopping medication often leads to relapse – the immune system falls back into its prior pathological activation state ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6709805/#:~:text=match%20at%20L218%20human%20body,The)).

- **Shared Biomarker Patterns (Common Attractor Signature):** If these syndromes are manifestations of the same attractor or neighboring ones, we’d expect common biomarker abnormalities. Recent studies indeed find **overlaps in laboratory and imaging findings** across ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, and Long COVID:
  - Immune signatures: A 2022 immunology study reported **elevated levels of certain autoantibodies in Long COVID** (anti-ACE2, anti-adrenergic, anti-muscarinic) similar to those found in POTS ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Multiple%20studies%20have%20found%20elevated,High%20levels%20of)). Another comprehensive analysis found that **Long COVID and ME/CFS share cytokine perturbations** – e.g., both often show an immune “exhaustion” profile with low NK cell function and slight increases in inflammatory cytokines ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=adrenergic%20receptor%20and%20muscarinic%20acetylcholine,of%20a)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=match%20at%20L905%20connective%20tissue,changes%20in%20the%20early%20versus)). There are also indications of **latent virus reactivations** (EBV, etc.) in both conditions ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=persisting%20reservoirs%20of%20SARS,Mechanistic%20studies)).
  - Autonomic and cardiovascular: As noted, **reduced heart rate variability** and small fiber neuropathy (indicating autonomic nerve involvement) are documented in fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, and Long COVID alike ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=adrenergic%20receptor%20and%20muscarinic%20acetylcholine,of%20a)). One study found **67% of Long COVID patients met criteria for POTS** (or had at least significant autonomic dysfunction) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=match%20at%20L539%20adrenergic%20receptor,of%20a)). This suggests the attractor often involves a dysautonomic state.
  - Metabolic: Metabolomic studies have revealed similar patterns in ME/CFS and Long COVID, such as **abnormalities in energy metabolism and lipid metabolism** ([Discriminating Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue ... - Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00669-7#:~:text=ME%2FCFS%20metabolomic%20profile.%20Metabolomic,biomarker%20effects%20for%20each%20condition)) ([Metabolomic Evidence for Peroxisomal Dysfunction in Myalgic ...](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/14/7906#:~:text=Metabolomic%20Evidence%20for%20Peroxisomal%20Dysfunction,the%20disease%2C%20demonstrating%20disturbances)). For instance, one 2023 metabolomics paper found that both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients show evidence of **peroxisomal dysfunction and accumulated oxidative stress** metabolites ([Metabolomic Evidence for Peroxisomal Dysfunction in Myalgic ...](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/14/7906#:~:text=Metabolomic%20Evidence%20for%20Peroxisomal%20Dysfunction,the%20disease%2C%20demonstrating%20disturbances)) ([Role of mitochondria, oxidative stress and the response to ...](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.11.002#:~:text=,inflammatory%20pathways%2C%20and%20brain%20dysfunction)). Another found a signature of low amino acids and altered tryptophan/kynurenine pathway in ME/CFS, which is now being investigated in Long COVID as well.
  - Neuroendocrine: We’ve discussed the low cortisol finding in Long COVID; interestingly, **blunted cortisol and low ACTH** have also been observed in a subset of fibromyalgia and CFS patients (some call it “hypocortisolism of chronic stress”) ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=were%20prominent%20and%20strikingly%2C%20depression,associated%20clinical%20and%20immunological%20manifestations)). This common endocrine abnormality hints that many patients are in a similar neurohormonal state.
  - Overlap of diagnoses: Epidemiologically, having one of these diagnoses increases the risk of others. Fibromyalgia commonly co-occurs with ME/CFS; POTS often co-exists with EDS and MCAS, etc. ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=following%20various%20triggers,This)). A recent Nature review noted **significantly increased risk of developing dysautonomia or ME/CFS after COVID-19 infection** ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=stroke%2C%20as%20studied%20with%20use,diabetes9%20%2C%20cardiovascular%20outcomes%2036)). These interrelationships support the idea that there is a shared underlying state (or propensity) that can manifest as various diagnoses depending on triggers and individual factors.

All the above are **supportive of a common attractor framework** – they show stability, self-perpetuation, and shared features. However, it’s important to consider evidence that **complicates or contradicts** a pure attractor hypothesis:

- **Role of Persistent Triggers:** One challenge to the attractor idea is evidence of ongoing triggers in some patients. For example, some Long COVID cases have been found to harbor **reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA** in tissues (gut, etc.) months later ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=persisting%20reservoirs%20of%20SARS,Mechanistic%20studies)). Others show continued presence of microclots and abnormal coagulation up to a year post-infection ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=impacts%20of%20SARS,Risk%20factors%20potentially)). If a persistent virus or microclots are continuously driving symptoms, then the illness is not solely an internally sustained state but is being actively provoked. That said, these factors might be part of the attractor – e.g., an immune system attractor that fails to fully clear the virus or resolve clots. Still, in such cases the model might need to include an ongoing perturbation term rather than a closed system. Additionally, **active autoimmunity** can be seen as a driver (autoantibodies continually produced by plasma cells). If the autoantibody production is sustained by antigen or other means, it’s an ongoing input. However, one could argue the immune network has an attractor that includes autoantibody production as a self-stabilizing loop (through epitope spreading, etc.). It’s notable that not all studies agree on autoantibodies – one large study did not find a major role for autoantibodies in Long COVID compared to acute COVID ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=match%20at%20L310%20comprehensive%20study%2C,major%20component%20of%20long%20COVID18)), implying heterogeneity. Some patients might be in an attractor mostly independent of autoimmunity.

- **Heterogeneity and Reversibility:** Not everyone with these conditions is locked in permanently. There is a spectrum – some patients improve over time, especially with interventions. For instance, a proportion of Long COVID patients (especially those with milder initial illness) do recover within 1–2 years. In ME/CFS, full recovery is uncommon, but partial improvement happens in perhaps 20–30% of patients over several years (as per some longitudinal studies). This could mean the attractor basin is not infinitely deep – some can climb out given enough time or with the right nudge. It’s also possible there are *multiple attractors* of differing severity, and patients can move from a worse one to a better one (e.g., from severe bedbound ME/CFS to a milder ambulatory CFS with some functionality – a change of state, though still not healthy). To validate the attractor concept, one would ideally demonstrate **bistability** or multistability experimentally – e.g., identify a biomarker that has a bimodal distribution or a system where two stable equilibria can be observed. This is hard in vivo, but computational models of sepsis and inflammation have shown bistable behavior (health vs. chronic inflammation). Clinically, the closest we see is that **early aggressive rest** after the trigger sometimes prevents chronic illness (some Long COVID clinics advocate rest in the acute phase to avoid ME/CFS development), whereas pushing too hard early can entrench the illness – implying path dependence and tipping points. A 2023 finding was that people who couldn’t **rest adequately in the weeks after COVID** (due to socioeconomic factors) had higher risk of Long COVID ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=many%20questions%20remain%20and%20are,Before%20the)). This supports the idea that exceeding certain stress thresholds before recovery can tip one into the chronic state. It also is consistent with the patient practice of “pacing”: carefully managing activity to stay below symptom-exacerbation threshold. Pacing doesn’t cure, but it can significantly improve quality of life and stability, as shown in a study where a structured pacing protocol **reduced post-exertional symptom crashes by two-thirds in long COVID patients over 6 weeks** ([
            Effect of using a structured pacing protocol on post‐exertional symptom exacerbation and health status in a longitudinal cohort with the post‐COVID‐19 syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878088/#:~:text=6%E2%80%90week%20structured%20World%20Health%20Organization,week%2C%20and%20reduction%20across%20all)) ([
            Effect of using a structured pacing protocol on post‐exertional symptom exacerbation and health status in a longitudinal cohort with the post‐COVID‐19 syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878088/#:~:text=questionnaire%20,A%20structured%20pacing%20protocol)). This indicates the state has a threshold behavior: avoid crossing the threshold, and the system stays in a more stable (if still pathological) sub-region; cross it and you temporarily fall into a worse sub-state.

In conclusion, recent evidence largely **reinforces the notion of a self-sustaining pathophysiological state** in these syndromes. The chronicity, overlap, and internal consistency of findings (low cortisol, low HRV, high oxidative stress, etc.) across diagnoses point to an entrenched network state rather than an ongoing external insult. To reconcile contradictions: it may be that some patients require a continuing driver (virus, autoimmunity) to stay in the attractor, whereas others, once pushed in, stay there without further provocation. This is analogous to how some autoimmune diseases need an initial trigger but then become self-perpetuating. For modeling, it means we might need to allow for both **open-system and closed-system scenarios** – but the attractor paradigm can accommodate that by enlarging the state-space to include pathogen load or autoantibody level as state variables too (which can themselves be stable if the immune system keeps producing them). The evidence is certainly converging on the idea that **these illnesses are not simply caused by one isolated defect, but by a network configuration** that is qualitatively different from health. This is precisely what an attractor represents. 

## Refinements and Future Directions for the GASLIT-AF Model  

To evolve the GASLIT-AF model from an intriguing hypothesis to a robust, clinically useful framework, several refinements are needed, incorporating insights from dynamical systems theory, personalized (precision) medicine, and computational modeling. Below we outline specific enhancements:

### A. Polygenic and Personalized Risk Profiles (Refining γ)  
Rather than a single γ value for genetic predisposition, the model should adopt a **polygenic risk vector**. This could involve integrating known genetic risk factors into subcomponents. For example: let γ = {γ<sub>immune</sub>, γ<sub>autonomic</sub>, γ<sub>connective</sub>, γ<sub>pain</sub>, …}, where each element represents the genetic load in a certain domain. γ<sub>immune</sub> might be high if a person carries HLA alleles associated with autoimmunity or low copies of C4 (which has been linked to lupus/autoimmune risk), or variants in cytokine genes that cause pro-inflammatory bias. γ<sub>autonomic</sub> could capture variants in adrenergic receptors, muscarinic receptors, or ion channels related to neuropathy risk (e.g., certain sodium channel polymorphisms linked to dysautonomia). γ<sub>connective</sub> would include collagen gene variants (like *TNXB* in the RCCX module ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=stress%20response%20and%20anxiety%20%2C,C4%29%2C%20and%20stress))) predisposing to EDS/hypermobility. γ<sub>pain</sub> could incorporate COMT variants (which affect pain sensitivity via catecholamine degradation ([
            Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): An Overview - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538807/#:~:text=%2A%20COMT%20%28catechol))) or opioid receptor polymorphisms, etc. Each patient could thus have a profile – essentially a personalized genetic risk signature – which the model uses as initial conditions. This aligns with precision medicine: rather than lumping all patients together, it acknowledges some are “genetically loaded” in particular pathways. Clinically, polygenic risk scores (PRS) for related conditions (autoimmune diseases, etc.) could be calculated for a patient and plugged into the model. A 2024 multi-ancestry study by 23andMe demonstrated the feasibility of PRS in this context: they found Long COVID had genetic correlations with **CFS, fibromyalgia, and depression** ([Multi-ancestry GWAS of Long COVID identifies immune-related loci and etiological links to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and depression | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.07.24315052v1#:~:text=match%20at%20L92%20fatigue%20,These%20findings%20can%20help)). Such information could inform the γ vector; e.g., a patient with a high PRS for fibromyalgia might be predicted by the model to have a stronger pain-centralization component. 

In addition, **epigenetic factors** should be incorporated as a dynamic influence on γ-related pathways. For instance, chronic stress might epigenetically downregulate glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity – effectively increasing γ<sub>endocrine</sub> vulnerability over time, even without genetic polymorphism. The model could allow γ to shift slowly over the lifespan due to “epigenetic load.” This could simulate how adverse childhood events or chronic stress beforehand set the stage (by altering gene expression or stress responsivity). Empirically, one could measure epigenetic marks (DNA methylation patterns) known to be associated with CFS ([Epigenetic reprograming in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38693641/#:~:text=,physiology%20associated%20with%20immune%20responses)) and feed that into the model’s parameters.

By refining γ in this way, the model also becomes **testable**: Does a patient’s genetic/epigenetic profile predict their trajectory or which sub-syndrome they express? It would also guide therapy – e.g., if someone has high γ<sub>immune</sub>, maybe immunomodulators are key; if high γ<sub>connective</sub>, they may benefit from bracing or avoiding extreme exertion that exploits their weak connective tissue, etc. This moves GASLIT-AF toward a personalized model: each individual’s attractor landscape might be slightly different based on their genetics. The attractor concept still holds, but there isn’t a one-size-fits-all attractor – rather a family of attractors modulated by γ. Computationally, one could simulate virtual patient cohorts with different γ vectors to see the range of outcomes, thereby reproducing the heterogeneity seen clinically.

### B. Quantifying Allostatic Load with Multi-Omics and Cumulative Indices  
To address the current vagueness of Λ, we propose the model include a formal **Allostatic Load Index (ALI)** that is derived from measurable variables. This ALI could be constructed similarly to how researchers like McEwen conceptualize allostatic load: by combining several biomarkers that reflect chronic stress impact. For example, ALI = a weighted sum of: resting cortisol (inverted, since lower cortisol may indicate chronic stress burnout ([A systematic review and meta-analysis of urinary biomarkers in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) | Journal of Translational Medicine | Full Text](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-023-04295-0#:~:text=Maloney%20et%20al,was%20not%20reported%20by%20Maloney))), DHEA (a resiliency hormone, low in chronic stress), inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP, etc.), metabolic markers (insulin resistance, leptin), autonomic markers (resting heart rate or HRV), and perhaps markers of wear-and-tear like telomere length. Some studies have already attempted to create such indices for CFS ([A systematic review and meta-analysis of urinary biomarkers in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) | Journal of Translational Medicine | Full Text](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-023-04295-0#:~:text=Maloney%20et%20al,was%20not%20reported%20by%20Maloney)). The model can adopt these – effectively treating Λ as **observable**. 

Furthermore, **multi-omics data** (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) can be leveraged to quantify the load the body is under. For instance, a high-expression of genes related to oxidative stress, or a metabolomic signature of cortisol metabolism and sympathetic overdrive, could feed into Λ. A 2022 metabolomic analysis identified a panel of urinary metabolites that correlated with high allostatic load in CFS (including cortisol metabolites) ([A systematic review and meta-analysis of urinary biomarkers in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) | Journal of Translational Medicine | Full Text](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-023-04295-0#:~:text=Maloney%20et%20al,was%20not%20reported%20by%20Maloney)) ([A systematic review and meta-analysis of urinary biomarkers in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) | Journal of Translational Medicine | Full Text](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-023-04295-0#:~:text=match%20at%20L895%2025,2006%3B7%283%29%3A467%E2%80%9373)). That kind of panel could be a readout for the model. Multi-omics profiling of patients vs. controls might reveal a composite “chronic stress signature” – possibly an increase in inflammatory gene expression alongside downregulation of energy metabolism genes, etc. This signature can be used as the state of Λ.

The model should also consider **psychosocial load**. Tools like the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) score or the Life Events stress score could be inputs. If a patient has a history of multiple traumas or long-term high-demand lifestyle, that contributes to Λ. In a computational model, one could simulate Λ accumulation as a function of stress events over time (with possible partial recovery between). The model might reveal how a certain trajectory of stress (frequency and intensity of stressors) leads to a critical Λ threshold crossing. Experimentally, this could be informed by longitudinal studies: e.g., follow people with high-stress jobs to see if their physiological markers move toward a threshold predictive of illness.

By quantifying Λ in such a multi-faceted way, any predictions the model makes can be checked against real patient data. For example, the model might predict that if ALI exceeds a certain value (say 8 on a 0–10 scale), the system will flip to the pathological attractor. We could then examine a cohort of at-risk individuals (e.g., healthcare workers post-COVID) and see if those with ALI > 8 indeed developed Long COVID at higher rates. This bridges theory with practical risk assessment – potentially allowing early intervention (e.g., “this patient’s allostatic load is critically high, we must reduce stress or support their system now to prevent collapse”).

### C. Broadening Buffering Capacity (Ω) Beyond ECS – Integrating Vagal, HPA, and Metabolic Resilience  
To improve Ω, we propose creating a **Composite Resilience Index** that encapsulates all major buffering systems. Concretely, one could define Ω = (Ω<sub>ECS</sub> + Ω<sub>ANS</sub> + Ω<sub>HPA</sub> + Ω<sub>Metabolic</sub> + Ω<sub>Others</sub>) / N, a normalized average of several subscores:
- **Ω<sub>ECS</sub> (Endocannabinoid System):** Measure endocannabinoid levels (anandamide, 2-AG) in blood or CSF, and perhaps check for functional polymorphisms in *CNR1*, *CNR2*, *FAAH*. Low levels or less-responsive receptors would lower this component. If data show fibromyalgia patients, for instance, have significantly lower anandamide on average ([Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Fibromyalgia](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/47/4/230#:~:text=The%20notion%20that%20fibromyalgia%20might,CECD)) ([Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Fibromyalgia](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/47/4/230#:~:text=suggests%20that%20an%20underlying%20deficiency,hypothesis%20is%20supported%20by%20evidence)), that would reflect in Ω<sub>ECS</sub>.
- **Ω<sub>ANS</sub> (Autonomic Nervous System):** Use **heart rate variability** (HRV) as a key metric. High resting HRV and good baroreflex sensitivity indicate strong vagal tone and adaptive autonomic modulation (high Ω<sub>ANS</sub>), whereas low HRV indicates the system has less flexibility to buffer stress (low Ω<sub>ANS</sub>). Another measure is the vagal tone index or even direct vagus nerve activity if one has such data. In addition, the ability of heart rate and blood pressure to recover quickly after a stress (cold pressor test or tilt test) could gauge this buffering. In the model, one could incorporate a parameter for baroreflex gain. Empirically, fibromyalgia patients have lower HRV ([Heart rate variability in patients with fibromyalgia and patients with ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248383489_Heart_rate_variability_in_patients_with_fibromyalgia_and_patients_with_chronic_fatigue_syndrome_A_systematic_review#:~:text=,rate%20variability%20and%20blunted)) and often an inability to activate parasympathetic response effectively; that would translate to a reduced Ω<sub>ANS</sub> in those patients.
- **Ω<sub>HPA</sub> (Endocrine Stress Response):** Assess adrenal reserve and HPA robustness. This can be done via an **ACTH stimulation test** or an **insulin tolerance test** to see how well cortisol can be produced under challenge. A simpler measure is the **cortisol awakening response (CAR)** – healthy individuals have a surge of cortisol in the morning that indicates a responsive HPA axis. Blunted CAR is seen in chronic fatigue and burnout. Chronic low cortisol (and low DHEA) would mean Ω<sub>HPA</sub> is low. This subscore might also include things like variability in blood pressure (since adrenal hormones affect that). The model could incorporate cortisol dynamics explicitly, but as a summary, one could say a patient with subnormal cortisol output has diminished buffering to any new stress.
- **Ω<sub>Metabolic</sub>:** Consider the capacity to meet energy demands – e.g., mitochondrial function and antioxidant capacity. A measure could be something like “maximal oxidative phosphorylation capacity” measured via muscle biopsy or advanced imaging, or more practically a patient’s performance on a 2-day CPET (cardiopulmonary exercise test). If their VO₂max drops dramatically on day 2 (inability to reproduce day1 performance), that shows a lack of metabolic buffering (they couldn’t replenish and adapt in 24 hours) ([Allostatic overload in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987713003137#:~:text=Allostatic%20overload%20in%20myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic,the%20physiological%20mechanisms%20employed)). Also, levels of antioxidants like glutathione or enzymes like superoxide dismutase could indicate if the body can buffer oxidative stress surges. Low GSH and high oxidative markers would reduce Ω<sub>Metabolic</sub>. Some emerging tests like the nanoneedle assay (which measures how cells’ impedance changes under salt stress) might correlate with cellular energy resilience; this was used experimentally to distinguish ME/CFS patients by showing their cells go into metabolic distress more easily than controls.
- **Ω<sub>Neural/Cognitive</sub> (if we expand further):** The brain’s capacity to maintain homeostasis – perhaps measured by something like ability to sustain attention or by heart rate variability during cognitive stress, etc. But this might overlap with ANS/HPA measures.

All these could be combined, perhaps not equally weighted – one might weight Ω<sub>ANS</sub> and Ω<sub>HPA</sub> highly given the evidence of their importance ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=functional%20damage%20to%20the%20main,inconsistent%20due%20to%20reduced%20vagal)) ([
            Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=analysis%20involving%20215%20individuals%20showed,reporting%20dramatically%20worsened%20quality%20of)). The model then would say: if the composite Ω falls below a critical level, the system can’t resist the pull into the bad attractor upon a significant perturbation. 

This refined Ω aligns with clinical observations: the patients who tend to develop these syndromes often have multiple resilience deficits. For example, veterans of the Gulf War who developed Gulf War Illness (similar to CMSS) had, in retrospect, poorer detoxification and antioxidant genes, plus high stress – a multifactorial lack of resilience. Or consider why **women** are more affected by ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, and Long COVID (the majority of patients are female). One reason could be differences in HPA-axis dynamics (women have lower cortisol on average in chronic stress) and perhaps differences in endocannabinoid or autonomic function. By quantifying Ω, one might capture sex differences (e.g., average vagal tone differences or hormone effects) that predispose women to the attractor state more. In fact, in Long COVID, female sex is a risk factor ([Frontiers | Connecting dots of long COVID-19 pathogenesis: a vagus nerve- hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal-mitochondrial axis dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1501949/full#:~:text=individuals%20%28Mastrorosa%20et%20al,been%20found%2C%20and%20no%20cures)); some speculate lower tolerance to immune activation (since pre-menopausal females already have higher baseline immune activation) or differences in stress responses might underlie this – which again are buffered by systems like HPA and ANS.

Including **vagus nerve function explicitly** under Ω is also supported by interventional evidence: boosting vagal activity via VNS improved symptoms (as discussed) ([
            Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation improves Long COVID symptoms in a female cohort: a pilot study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11097097/#:~:text=observed%20significant%20improvements%20across%20cognitive,up%2C%20eventually%20reaching%20significance.%20Similarly)), which implies raising Ω helped lift patients partially out of the state. The model could simulate that: increase Ω<sub>ANS</sub> parameter, and see the system move toward stability or out of the attractor basin. Similarly, consider **ECS-targeted therapies**: some fibromyalgia patients use cannabinoid agonists (medical cannabis) and report pain relief and better sleep. If ECS deficiency was part of their low Ω, then supplementing it raises Ω and should shrink the basin of pathological attractor, making symptoms less entrenched. The model could test a hypothetical increase in Ω<sub>ECS</sub> and see if, say, inflammation variable goes down (because ECS activation reduces inflammation). 

In short, broadening Ω to a **holistic resilience factor** makes the model both more realistic and more amenable to testing interventions. We can literally measure many aspects of resilience in patients and cross-validate with model predictions of who falls ill. It also means treatment can aim at **strengthening the buffers** – for example, graded HRV biofeedback training to improve vagal tone, or mindfulness to normalize cortisol patterns, or CoQ10 + antioxidant therapy to improve mitochondrial resilience (which some trials in ME/CFS and fibromyalgia have tried, with modest success). By acknowledging all these in Ω, the model would encourage a multimodal treatment approach – which many clinicians already find necessary (address sleep, address orthostatic intolerance, address nutrition, etc. in combination).

### D. Defining and Measuring Entropy (σ) and Coherence (C) in Practice  
To rescue the useful concepts of σ and C, we should tie them to concrete metrics:
- **Physiological Entropy (σ):** We propose defining σ in the model as **the aggregate disorder or variability in key physiological outputs**. One approach: take several time-series signals (heart inter-beat interval, blood pressure, body temperature, activity level, perhaps cytokine level fluctuations, etc.) and compute a composite entropy measure such as **multivariate sample entropy** or **multiscale entropy**. This would yield a number representing how unpredictable and complex the dynamics are. Research has shown that healthy individuals have an optimal range of complexity, and both highly random and overly regular patterns can indicate pathology ([Reduced complexity of activity patterns in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: a case control study | BioPsychoSocial Medicine | Full Text](https://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0759-3-7#:~:text=data%20can%20be%20used%20to,complexity%20compared%20to%20healthy%20controls)). For example, a healthy heart has a certain variability; in heart failure, heart rate might become either too erratic or too monolithic. In ME/CFS, the study we cited found lower entropy in activity patterns ([Reduced complexity of activity patterns in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: a case control study | BioPsychoSocial Medicine | Full Text](https://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0759-3-7#:~:text=CFS%20cases%20showed%20reduced%20complexity,after%20adjustment%20for%20total%20activity)), which suggests that in the time-scale of days, their behavior is more constrained (likely due to self-pacing to avoid crashes – an interesting adaptive phenomenon). On shorter timescales, maybe their HRV is low (less entropy in milliseconds fluctuations). So likely, the chronic state has *lower entropy in some metrics* (like fractal complexity). However, it might have *higher entropy production* in a thermodynamic sense if inefficiencies abound (like futile metabolic cycles or chronic inflammation generating heat and waste – essentially the body “revving in place”). 

To reconcile this, the model could split σ into two sub-concepts: σ<sub>physio</sub> (entropy in physiological signal patterns) and σ<sub>thermo</sub> (entropy in energy metabolism). We could then attempt to measure σ<sub>thermo</sub> by something like **resting energy expenditure (REE)** or **heat release** relative to work done. Some Long COVID and ME/CFS patients have an elevated REE or reduced exercise efficiency (more calories burned for less work), which implies energy is being wasted unproductively – a form of high entropy production. Another angle: measure **entropy of immune repertoire** – in autoimmunity, the immune response might become less specific and more chaotic (producing random autoantibodies). If data permit, one could measure diversity of antibodies or T-cell clones; a very broad, non-specific activation could be thought of as higher entropy immune response (versus a targeted, coherent response to a pathogen). 

But practically, focusing on signals like HRV, activity, sleep EEG might suffice. The model should commit: e.g., “σ corresponds to the multiscale entropy of autonomic fluctuations” – which we can calculate. Then we can see: do patients have higher or lower values? If not matching the hypothesis, adjust the theory. Perhaps the model will find that it’s *loss of complexity* (low entropy) that actually is the problem, and revise accordingly. That wouldn’t break the attractor idea; it would just mean the attractor is a “low complexity state” (like a shallow oscillation or some fixed pattern) rather than a noisy chaotic state. Notably, some have theorized that **health lies at the edge of chaos** – a balance of order and disorder – and chronic diseases often represent either too much order (rigidity) or too much chaos (random instability). It could be that CMSSs lean toward the “too ordered (but pathological order)” side, which might correspond to *low* σ in some respects. The model can accommodate this by adjusting what σ signifies. The key is to define it so it can be measured.

- **Physiological Coherence (C):** We propose defining coherence as **the degree of synchronization or coupling between different oscillatory or regulatory processes in the body**. For instance, one specific metric is **cardiorespiratory coherence** – how well heart rate oscillations synchronize with breathing (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). High coherence there is generally a sign of a strong vagal tone and a calm state (some biofeedback techniques train individuals to breathe at ~0.1 Hz to maximize heart-breath coherence, which is associated with stress reduction). Patients might have disturbances in this; maybe their heart rate doesn’t smoothly oscillate with breathing due to autonomic imbalance. Another coherence aspect: **circadian coherence** – normally, various hormones and physiological processes align with the 24-hour cycle (cortisol high in morning, melatonin at night, body temperature oscillation, etc.). In chronic illness, this coherence is often lost – e.g., some ME/CFS patients have flattened diurnal cortisol or irregular sleep-wake cycles, indicating the internal clocks are not in sync. We saw evidence that ME/CFS serum messed up cellular rhythms in vitro ([Serum from Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165572823001285#:~:text=Serum%20from%20Myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic%20fatigue,coherence%20of%20rhythms%20over%20time)). So one could measure a person’s hormone and activity rhythms to quantify circadian coherence. Additionally, **coherence between the brain and body signals**: e.g., how heart rate and blood pressure changes correlate with neural activity or with cognitive state. Possibly use coherence analysis on EEG and other signals.

On a network level, **coherence can be thought of as network connectivity**: one could take a range of physiological variables and compute pairwise correlations or coherence spectra. A high-coherence healthy state might mean everything moves in a coordinated way when needed (like during exercise, multiple systems ramp up together; during rest, they all down-regulate). A low-coherence state might show subsystems acting independently or paradoxically (e.g., heart rate is high but blood pressure is low – a mismatch; or cortisol is low despite high inflammation – an uncoupling of endocrine and immune). We can capture that by looking at joint dynamics. The model could incorporate C as something like the average correlation among key regulatory variables (with a caveat that too high constant correlation could also be pathological, but likely in these patients it’s more of a decoupling issue).

By measuring these, one could identify a “fingerprint” of the pathological state: perhaps something like **low coherence across circadian hormones and autonomic signals, combined with reduced complexity of variability**. In fact, this sounds like what’s observed: the systems aren’t talking to each other properly (low coherence) and the overall variability is reduced (like an engine stuck idling). For example, a healthy person under stress has a coordinated response (HR, BP, cortisol all rise together), and then all fall together – high coherence in response. A ME/CFS patient under stress might get racing heart but cortisol barely rises (low coherence between ANS and HPA), and then they crash for a day (their systems didn’t smoothly recover). If we quantify that, we can validate the model’s description of “low C, high σ” or adjust it to “low C, low complexity.”

Technologically, **wearable sensors and home monitoring** can supply a lot of these data continuously. Heart rate, activity, temperature, etc. can be tracked, and algorithms can compute entropy and coherence measures. If the model claims an intervention (like VNS or pacing) increases coherence, we could see if HRV coherence or circadian alignment improves with those interventions. In VNS pilot, for example, patients had improved cognition and mood ([
            Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation improves Long COVID symptoms in a female cohort: a pilot study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11097097/#:~:text=observed%20significant%20improvements%20across%20cognitive,up%2C%20eventually%20reaching%20significance.%20Similarly)); one might guess their heart-brain coherence improved (maybe measurable via EEG-HRV analysis). These could be tested in future studies.

Defining σ and C concretely also ties into **dynamical systems theory**: one could estimate the “attractor” from patient data using state-space reconstruction and see if patients’ physiological state-space plots show a distinct topology vs. controls. Techniques like recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) could measure determinism and entropy in the dynamics, giving another way to characterize the attractor.

In summary, refining σ and C to be measurable will transform them from abstract ideas into parameters that can be tracked as outcomes. For instance, we could say: _Goal: increase coherence (e.g., improve circadian alignment and ANS synchronization) and restore healthy variability (entropy) without pathological randomness._ This aligns with treatments like **pacing** (which implicitly tries to restore a more regular activity-rest rhythm – increasing coherence in daily pattern, while avoiding chaotic crashes), or **graded exercise therapy** (controversial in ME/CFS, but intended to gently nudge variability tolerance – though if done incautiously it causes crashes, showing the attractor’s resistance). 

### E. Accommodating Phenotype-Specific Pathways (Differentiating Attractor Sub-States)  
To address the critique about phenotypes, the refined model should explicitly allow for **multiple stable sub-states or “attractor variants.”** One way is to introduce additional dimensions or modules for specific symptom domains, and allow different weights. For example, include a **mast cell activation module** that can toggle on or off the release of histamine and inflammatory mediators, feeding into the overall system. Patients with prominent MCAS would have that module set to a sensitive state (mast cells easily triggered, leading to more frequent bouts of inflammation and autonomic reflex activation). Others might have that module relatively quiet. Similarly, include a **pain modulation loop** (perhaps a model of spinal cord dorsal horn sensitization with a feedback from stress hormones or immune signals). In fibromyalgia-dominant patients, give that loop high gain (so it easily amplifies and sustains pain signals). In a primarily POTS patient, include a **blood volume and vascular tone module** – e.g., low blood volume and excessive venous pooling (as some POTS patients have) can itself be an attractor: low flow -> brain fog -> inactivity -> deconditioning -> worse orthostasis, etc. Those with that issue would have parameters reflecting it (like lower total blood volume in the model).

Another approach is to treat each syndrome as a node on a network of overlapping networks. For instance, depict an “autonomic network,” an “immune network,” a “connective tissue network,” etc., that all interact. The pathological state might correspond to one or more networks tipping into dysfunction. Then phenotypes differ by which networks are most affected. To personalize the model, one could attempt to classify patients by phenotype using data (this is where machine learning clustering on biomarkers and symptoms could help). For example, recent clustering studies on ME/CFS have identified subgroups: one subgroup with more immune activation, another with more autonomic dysfunction, etc. These could correspond to different parameter sets in the model. A future refinement is to incorporate a **Bayesian or machine learning layer** that, given a particular patient’s data, estimates their model parameter values (γ, Λ, Ω, etc. and other subsystem-specific parameters). Essentially, each patient gets a digital twin model fit to their profile. This is ambitious but increasingly plausible with better computing and data. In 2023, there was work on a “digital twin” approach for ME/CFS ([Applying a Digital Twin Approach for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ...](https://meridian.allenpress.com/innovationsjournals-IDDB/article/3/2023/40/497662/Applying-a-Digital-Twin-Approach-for-Myalgic#:~:text=Applying%20a%20Digital%20Twin%20Approach,field%20of%20cardiovascular%20diseases)), aiming to dynamically track a patient’s status and predict crashes. If our refined GASLIT-AF were structured properly, it could serve as the blueprint for such digital twins.

Additionally, acknowledging phenotype differences means we should also incorporate **trigger-specific pathways**. For instance, if infection is the trigger (as in Long COVID or post-mononucleosis ME/CFS), perhaps persistent viral antigens or dysbiosis are part of the ongoing state. If physical trauma is the trigger (as in some fibromyalgia cases after an accident), maybe microglial activation in the CNS from injury is the key. The model can include those as optional components: e.g. a “pathogen reservoir” variable that decays over time but might not fully go to zero in some cases, continuing to stimulate the immune system (representing lingering virus). Or an “autoantibody titer” variable that is produced by B-cells and causes receptor interference (as seen in POTS). These can be toggled in simulations to see how the presence or absence changes outcomes – thereby reflecting why not all patients have every feature.

The benefit of explicitly modeling these subcomponents is it allows the attractor to have internal structure. Instead of a single blob state, it’s like a landscape with a few nearby valleys. The patient might be in valley A (mostly autonomic) or valley B (mostly immune) or on the saddle between them experiencing both. Actually, some patients do move: for example, many long-term ME/CFS patients accumulate more issues over time (some develop POTS or MCAS after years of illness), suggesting their state may drift or deepen into adjacent attractors. The model could simulate that: if certain feedback loops gradually worsen (maybe due to ongoing oxidative damage or new autoantibodies), the patient’s state can shift from one attractor to an even worse one (this aligns with the concept of **progression or comorbidity accrual** as often seen).

To test this refined view, we can look for differential markers: e.g., do patients with predominant POTS signs have different network connectivity on analysis than those with predominant pain? There is evidence: brain fMRI studies show some differences – fibromyalgia has more pronounced alterations in pain-processing regions; ME/CFS has more in cognitive and motor regions; POTS might have more in brainstem blood flow regulation. A unified model can explain all if it’s allowed to vary parameters. 

In practice, refining in this way means **customizing interventions**. The model could be used as a clinical decision support tool: identify which feedback loops are most broken in an individual, then target those. For example, if model fitting reveals a patient has a very weak baroreflex and high sympathetic drive (but not so much autoimmunity), then treatments like ivabradine (to reduce heart rate) or salt+fludrocortisone (to boost volume) might stabilize them more effectively than, say, immunosuppressants. Conversely, if another patient’s model indicates strong autoimmune loop (high autoantibody production parameter), then therapies like IVIG or plasmapheresis (which some Long COVID and POTS studies are exploring) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=match%20at%20L539%20adrenergic%20receptor,of%20a)) make sense to test. 

The refined model can thus become a platform for **in silico trials**: simulate patient subgroups and test which interventions (modeled by altering specific parameters or adding new feedbacks) shift them towards health. For example, simulate adding a vagus nerve stimulator (which would increase Ω<sub>ANS</sub> and perhaps increase coherence between heart and immune system), and see if the state moves. Or simulate an IL-6 blocker drug (affecting an immune feedback). The outcomes can guide real trials.

### F. Incorporating Explicit Feedback Loop Models and Network Simulations  
We recommend that GASLIT-AF graduate from a conceptual model to a **computational model** – likely a set of differential equations or an agent-based model capturing the key feedback loops. For instance, one could start with a simplified but biologically grounded model: 

- Let’s say we have variables for cortisol (X), systemic inflammation level (I), autonomic outflow (A), and perhaps energy/ATP availability (E). We write equations for their interactions: 
  - dX/dt = f<sub>1</sub>(stress input, HPA feedback) – maybe something like: stress increases X, but X feedback inhibits itself (modeling HPA negative feedback); chronic high I might suppress X production (as some cytokines do blunt adrenal output).
  - dI/dt = f<sub>2</sub>(immune activation, cortisol, vagal) – e.g., I increases if there’s trigger or if not suppressed by X and A (vagal anti-inflammatory). Put a term where X and A reduce I. Also include auto-amplification if I is high (cytokine cascades can be self-amplifying).
  - dA/dt = f<sub>3</sub>(brainstem/autonomic feedback) – e.g., A goes up if I is high (inflammation triggers sympathetic response) or if blood pressure is low; A goes down if X is high (cortisol can modulate autonomic) or if parasympathetic is stimulated.
  - dE/dt = f<sub>4</sub>(mitochondrial function, I) – e.g., E (energy) drops if I is high (since inflammation causes energy diversion), and E recovers slowly based on metabolic capacity; low E might feed back to increase I (if low energy leads to cell stress signals) or to increase stress signals (because body senses energy crisis). 
  - Include also perhaps something for oxidative stress (O) linked with E and I. 
  - And a variable for “symptoms” S which could be a function of I, A, and E (since inflammation, autonomic activation, and low energy all produce symptoms).

While this is oversimplified, one can tune parameters to simulate different scenarios. We can then analyze the equilibria of these equations. Are there two or more stable equilibrium points? For plausible parameter values, one might find a stable high-I, low-X, low-E state (representing illness) and a stable low-I, moderate-X, high-E state (health). The basin of attraction can be characterized by, say, the value of Ω or Λ. We can use bifurcation analysis to see what critical values cause the state to switch. This would mathematically validate the attractor hypothesis and give insight into what pushes the system over the edge.

Additionally, a **network-based approach** (like boolean networks or Bayesian networks) could be employed if differential equations are too detailed. Kauffman’s work, for example, has shown gene regulatory networks can have attractors corresponding to cell types ([
            Attractor – a new turning point in drug discovery - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6709805/#:~:text=There%20have%20been%20some%20paradigms,determined%20by%20the%20gene%20expression)); similarly, one could design a network of physiological “nodes” (HPA, ANS, immune, metabolic, coagulatory, etc.) with logical rules or probabilistic transitions to see emergent stable patterns. In fact, one reference in the tweet snippet was “Modeling the Attractor Landscape of Disease Progression: a Network-Based Approach” ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=67,STRUCTURES%20Blog%2C%20https%3A%2F%2Fstructures.uni)) – likely a 2017 article that could be instructive on methodology for this kind of modeling. Using such methods, one could attempt to reconstruct a plausible “energy landscape” with a healthy valley and a chronic illness valley. 

One promising direction is to utilize patient data to **train or calibrate** the model. For example, using longitudinal data from patients who went from acute COVID to Long COVID, we could attempt to fit the model’s trajectory. Did their cortisol drop first or their inflammation stay high? What preceded the switch? If a model can be tuned to replicate an individual’s course, that’s effectively a validated digital twin. Already, there's a push to integrate multi-omics and machine learning to predict ME/CFS onset ([Machine learning and multi-omics in precision medicine for ME/CFS](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-024-05915-z#:~:text=ME%2FCFS%20translational,transform%20precision%20medicine%20in)). If the model can incorporate those omics as parameters, we could potentially predict who is at risk by plugging in their values.

The refined model should also propose **specific experiments** to test its components. For instance:
- A **provocation test** (like an exercise or orthostatic test) combined with multi-omics measurements before and after. The model would predict that healthy individuals return to baseline (their state variable vector returns to pre-test values) by, say, 24h, whereas susceptible individuals overshoot into a new state (e.g., their inflammation stays elevated, their cortisol stays low, and their gene expression profile shifts to one similar to known ME/CFS patients). This kind of experiment is being done: two-day CPET with metabolomics, etc., and indeed differences are seen ([Plasma metabolomics reveals disrupted response and recovery ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9090259/#:~:text=Plasma%20metabolomics%20reveals%20disrupted%20response,30%20female%2C%2015%20male)).
- **Intervention tests:** try a targeted intervention in a controlled trial and see if it shifts the predicted variables. For example, an ongoing trial in Long COVID is using cortisol replacement in the morning (since cortisol is low). The model would predict that raising X (cortisol) should push down I (inflammation) and improve E (energy) if HPA feedback was a key part. Observing clinical improvement and biomarker changes would support that feedback loop’s role. Another trial is using **BC007**, an aptamer that soaks up GPCR autoantibodies, in Long COVID/POTS. If those patients improve, it directly supports the notion that autoantibody-driven feedback disruption was maintaining their attractor – something the model can simulate by removing an autoantibody variable.

Finally, the refined model should incorporate **learning and adaptation**. Real biological systems can adapt – e.g., receptors downregulate, gene expression changes over time. This can either entrench the attractor (like tolerance to stress hormones, making it harder to escape the state) or sometimes facilitate escape (if some compensatory mechanism kicks in after long time). The model can include slow “adaptive” variables for this (like receptor sensitivity that changes in response to prolonged high or low levels). That might reproduce phenomena like why some patients gradually improve after years (maybe receptor levels normalize somewhat).

### G. Testing the Model – Multi-Disciplinary Research Designs  
To truly validate and refine GASLIT-AF, a **multi-disciplinary research effort** is needed, combining clinical studies and computational modeling. Some concrete proposals:
- **Longitudinal Cohort with Multi-Omics:** Follow individuals from the time of a known precipitating event (e.g., a cohort of people with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, or acute COVID-19) and collect data at multiple time points: acute, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months. Perform multi-omics at each point: genomics (once, for predisposition), transcriptomics (to see gene expression shifts), proteomics (inflammatory mediators, etc.), metabolomics (energy pathways), and clinical phenotyping (symptoms, tilt test, etc.). See who develops chronic illness. Use the model to retroactively analyze: do those who transitioned show a particular pattern (like a failure of cortisol to recover, or an unresolved inflammatory gene expression pattern)? Does the model, with certain parameter thresholds, correctly classify who will become chronic? This kind of study is underway in some respects (e.g., NIH’s RECOVER program for Long COVID, and UK’s DecodeME for ME/CFS genetics), but the data need to be integrated via a model. If, for example, we find that at 3 months, people who will remain ill have already diverged in a set of 5 parameters (maybe cortisol, IL-6, autoantibodies, HRV, lactate clearance), that essentially maps out the attractor entry. It would empirically verify the concept of a tipping point.

- **Physiological Network Modeling:** Develop a computer simulation (using differential equations or an agent-based approach as described) that includes at least the HPA axis, autonomic nervous system, immune system, and energy metabolism. Parameterize it with literature values (e.g., known rates of cortisol feedback, cytokine kinetics, etc.). Then perform *in silico* experiments: increase chronic stress input and see if the system has two outcomes (some runs end in a stable low-inflammation state, others in chronic inflammation depending on initial conditions and noise). One can also incorporate **stochasticity** to see if random fluctuations could tip the system – representing why perhaps some unlucky individuals tipped over while others didn’t, even with similar initial risk (chance can play a role if the basin boundary is near). By experimenting on this virtual model, one can identify which feedback loop is most crucial – e.g., if we remove the vagal anti-inflammatory pathway in the model, does it always go to illness? If yes, that underscores the importance of vagal function (and might spur prioritizing therapies like VNS or vagal nerve exercises).

- **Threshold Identification via Stress-Tests:** Design controlled stress-tests for patients and controls to identify thresholds. For example, a gradually increasing exercise test (ramp exercise until symptoms). Measure not just when the person stops, but what physiological changes occur at their threshold. Perhaps patients will show a break in coherence at a certain heart rate – e.g., HR and BP no longer correlate properly beyond a certain workload, indicating autonomic decompensation. Or lactate starts accumulating at a much lower work rate than in controls, indicating metabolic threshold exceeded. These thresholds could be quantified (like an anaerobic threshold, or a “cognitive load” threshold via a cognitive challenge). The model can then be tuned to reproduce those threshold phenomena. If the model can simulate an exercise test and yields a threshold beyond which variables diverge (like skyrocketing I or dropping E), that would mirror the patient experience of “push just a bit too far, and you crash.”

- **Intervention Trials Based on Model Predictions:** Use the model to propose combination treatments and test them. For instance, the model might predict that simultaneously addressing two loops gives a synergistic effect (because it pushes the state out of the attractor more decisively). This could be trialed: e.g., a trial of **vagus nerve stimulation + an anti-inflammatory drug + graded exercise** vs. each alone. If the combined approach markedly improves coherence and reduces symptoms according to our metrics, it supports the multi-loop nature of the attractor. There’s precedent: some studies show that multidisciplinary rehab (physical, cognitive, and medical) does slightly better than single modalities, but results have been modest. The model might indicate new combos (like add a metabolic augmentor such as D-ribose or NAD+ supplement to an immunotherapy). 

- **Biomarker-guided subgroups:** As per personalized profiles, test interventions on subgroups that the model says should respond. For example, those with high autoantibody levels (and model indicating autoantibody-driven autonomic dysfunction) get a trial of immunoadsorption or rituximab. Interestingly, rituximab (a B-cell depleting antibody) was tried in ME/CFS in Norway because some patients improved on it; the trials overall were inconclusive, but a subset did respond. Perhaps the model could identify that subset by their parameter values (maybe those had high γ<sub>immune</sub> and signs of autoimmune loop activation). If targeted correctly, one might finally get a positive trial for that subset. Conversely, those with primarily energy/metabolic issues might benefit from metabolic modulators (like acetyl-L-carnitine, CoQ10, or even experimental things like SS-31 peptide that improves mitochondrial function). Small trials of CoQ10 in fibromyalgia showed modest improvements in fatigue and some inflammation markers, hinting that targeting metabolism helps a bit. The model can integrate multiple moderate improvements to see if collectively they reach a tipping back to health.

Lastly, continuously update the model with new data – as the field learns more (e.g., if a new cytokine or nerve receptor is found to be key), it can be incorporated. The model thus becomes a living framework that both interprets existing evidence and guides new research – a hallmark of a mature scientific theory.

## Conclusion  
The GASLIT-AF model represents a bold step toward explaining chronic multi-system syndromes as emergent phenomena of dysregulated physiology, but it requires significant refinement to match the complexity of real-world data. By expanding genetic risk beyond a single number, rigorously quantifying allostatic load, broadening the concept of buffering capacity to include all major homeostatic systems, and concretely defining entropy and coherence, we can transform GASLIT-AF from an abstract idea into a testable, quantifiable model. Recent studies lend credence to the notion of chronic illness attractor states – patients appear “stuck” in self-perpetuating dysfunction, with measurable patterns like low cortisol, autonomic imbalance, immune activation, and metabolic inefficiency that align with a stable altered state ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=analysis%20involving%20215%20individuals%20showed,reporting%20dramatically%20worsened%20quality%20of)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=match%20at%20L539%20adrenergic%20receptor,of%20a)). At the same time, these syndromes exhibit heterogeneity, indicating multiple flavors of the pathological attractor; our proposed refinements embrace this by allowing phenotype-specific pathways and personalized parameters. 

Incorporating known feedback loops (HPA, autonomic, immune, metabolic) into the model not only grounds it in established biology ([Frontiers | A Paradigm for Post-Covid-19 Fatigue Syndrome Analogous to ME/CFS](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.701419/full#:~:text=hypothalamic%20paraventricular%20nucleus%20%28PVN%29,ME%2FCFS%2C%20that%20perpetuate%20an%20ongoing)) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519365/#:~:text=match%20at%20L272%20COVID%20compared,10)), but also highlights actionable nodes for intervention – essentially pointing to a system-of-systems approach to treatment. The refined model suggests that effective management of CMSSs will likely require **combination therapies targeting multiple feedback loops simultaneously** (for example, vagus nerve stimulation to restore autonomic feedback ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878088/#:~:text=questionnaire%20,A%20structured%20pacing%20protocol)), and perhaps immunotherapies to reset immune homeostasis ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Multiple%20studies%20have%20found%20elevated,High%20levels%20of))). By testing such approaches in silico and in vivo, we can identify which interventions might yield synergistic improvements in patient coherence and resilience. 

Crucially, the refined GASLIT-AF model can serve as a framework for integrating the deluge of data emerging from Long COVID and related research. As multi-omics studies and large patient cohorts divulge new insights (such as specific gene variants, autoantibodies, or metabolic signatures associated with chronic outcomes), those can be naturally incorporated into the model’s parameters and structure ([Multi-ancestry GWAS of Long COVID identifies immune-related loci and etiological links to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and depression | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.07.24315052v1#:~:text=The%20etiology%20of%20Long%20COVID,Functional%20analysis%20of%20these)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations | Nature Reviews Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Multiple%20studies%20have%20found%20elevated,High%20levels%20of)). In this way, GASLIT-AF could evolve into a kind of **systems medicine platform** for chronic syndromes – something that clinicians could one day use to input a patient’s data and receive a personalized map of their physiological state (and perhaps suggestions of how to nudge them toward health). While we are still some steps away from that ideal, the path is clear. It will require collaboration across disciplines: dynamical systems theorists to formalize the attractor landscapes, bioinformaticians to integrate multi-dimensional data, and clinicians to design smart trials that probe the model’s predictions.

In summary, by enhancing the critique-identified areas with evidence-backed modifications, we reinforce the central idea that CMSSs are not organ-specific diseases but network disorders – a breakdown of the delicate synchronization and balance that normally keeps our multi-system human organism in a healthy stable state. The suffering of patients long dismissed as “medically unexplained” can finally be understood as the physiology-wide chaos that it is: **a body locked in an emergent state of disorder**. With a refined GASLIT-AF model, we take a significant step toward explaining that disorder, finding its leverage points, and ultimately, guiding patients out of the darkness of the chronic illness attractor and back toward the light of health and coherence.
