# GASLIT-AF

### Genetic Autonomic Structural Linked Instability Theorem - Allodynic Fatigue
A Dynamical Systems Model for ME/CFS, Long COVID, POTS, hEDS, Fibromyalgia, MCAS, and friends.

## 🧠 TL;DR For Patients

You’re not crazy. You’re not weak. You’re not imagining it.

Your body may be stuck in a feedback loop—a system crash where everything that’s supposed to regulate your health (nervous system, hormones, immunity, energy) gets caught in a vicious cycle. GASLIT-AF is a model that explains this scientifically, showing how chronic illness isn’t random—it’s a system-level collapse into a "pathological attractor."

Think of your body like a spaceship. Normally it auto-adjusts to keep you alive. But if the stress load gets too high and your emergency systems fail, it can spiral out of control... and then stay stuck there.

GASLIT-AF says:

Genetics loads the gun 🔬

Chronic stress pulls the trigger ☢️

And the body's buffers (like the endocannabinoid system) get overwhelmed 🌊

Symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, pain, brain fog, and hypersensitivity aren’t random—they’re signs your whole system has flipped into a different operating mode. The good news? If we understand the loops, we can start designing ways out.

## 🧰 Key Concepts (Plain English Edition)

Attractor state: A pattern your body gets stuck in (e.g., chronic inflammation or fatigue).

Allostatic load (Λ): Your system’s stress backlog. The unpaid debt.

Buffering (Ω): Your built-in resilience: ECS tone, vagus nerve, antioxidants, etc.

Genetic fragility (γ): Pre-loaded system weaknesses (e.g., EDS, COMT, RCCX variants).

Recursive collapse: You crash, recover partially, crash again—each time getting worse.

## 🧬 For Clinicians & Biohackers

GASLIT-AF is a nonlinear dynamical model describing chronic multi-system syndromes (CMSS) as a transition into maladaptive attractors driven by genetic predisposition, accumulated stress, and failure of regulatory subsystems.

System Variables:

$Ψ(t)$ = physiological state vector

$γ$ = genetic fragility index

$Λ(t)$ = allostatic load

$Ω(t)$ = buffering capacity

$σ(t)$ = entropy production

$C(t)$ = coherence across subsystems

Transitions occur when $\Lambda$ passes a bifurcation threshold, $Ω$ collapses, and self-reinforcing loops (neuroimmune, autonomic, metabolic, limbic) lock the system in a pathological state.

## 🧠🌀 For Systems Thinkers & Complexity Scientists

This is a multiscale attractor-collapse model formalized via nonlinear ODEs, with feedback coupling modulated by genetic topology ($γ$), stress integral ($Λ$), and damping/resonance matrices (via $Ω$).

Phase transitions modeled via saddle-node or subcritical Hopf bifurcations.

Recursive hysteresis loops prevent reversion to $Ψ_{healthy}$.

Breakdown in cross-component coherence ($C$) corresponds to loss of adaptive synchrony.

Potential for fractal basins within $Ψ_{ill}$, explaining subtype variability.

## 🤖 For AI Researchers & Cyberneticists

GASLIT-AF treats the body as a recursive error-correcting system with decoherence failure.

Attractor states map to eigenmodes of physiological phase space.

Genetic compression artifacts (RCCX) act as entropic sinks.

Collapse modeled as a loss of adaptive negative feedback & increase in nonlinearity-amplifying gain.

Restoration requires systemwide re-synchronization—via ECS amplification, vagal tone stimulation, metabolic reset, or exogenous circuit dampening (e.g. LDN, beta blockers, neural retraining).

Suitable for digital twin implementation via dynamic parameter tracking and bifurcation mapping.

## 📡 For the Brave Souls at the Edge of Madness

You know the truth: this isn’t just illness. It’s a failed resonance pattern.

Your body—a biofractal antenna—got hit with too much entropy and couldn’t re-cohere.

GASLIT-AF is the diagnostic geometry of that failure.

You fell out of the harmonic basin.

But systems can be entrained. Oscillations can lock. Information can synchronize. Recovery is a resonance realignment, not just a prescription.

So get in tune. We're debugging the attractor. Together.

Welcome to the rebellion.

## ✊ Final Word

This repo is dedicated to everyone who's been gaslit by medicine, family, or even themselves. Chronic illness is real. Complexity is not a cop-out—it's the key. GASLIT-AF aims to turn suffering into signal.

If the system won't listen, build a better one.

Let’s model our way out.
