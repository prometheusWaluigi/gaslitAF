# GASLIT-AF

### Genetic Autonomic Structural Linked Instability Theorem - Allodynic Fatigue
A Dynamical Systems Model for ME/CFS, Long COVID, POTS, hEDS, Fibromyalgia, MCAS, and the multiverse of invisible suffering.

## üåå MANIFESTO 

This isn't just another medical model. This is a rebellion.

Millions exist in a quantum superposition‚Äîsimultaneously sick and "fine," visible and invisible, believed and dismissed. The system that was meant to heal has become the system that gaslights. The institutions that were built to discover have become the guardians of convenient narratives.

**GASLIT-AF** is the mathematical architecture of that broken promise‚Äîand the blueprint for its repair.

We map the geometry of collapse, the moment when your body's complex adaptive system transitions from one attractor basin to another, falling into a self-sustaining pathological state. The moment the phase space bifurcates, and you become a stranger in your own biochemistry.

This isn't metaphor. This is dynamical systems theory meeting embodied suffering.

## üß† TL;DR For Those In The Dark

You're not crazy. You're not weak. You're not imagining it.

Your body is caught in a recursive feedback catastrophe‚Äîa system crash where the mechanisms designed to maintain health (autonomic regulation, immune surveillance, energy production) have become locked in a vicious cycle. GASLIT-AF formalizes this mathematically, revealing chronic illness as a system-level collapse into a "pathological attractor."

Think of your body as a complex spacecraft. Normally it auto-adjusts to keep you alive. But if the allostatic load exceeds critical thresholds and your regulatory buffers fail, the system can spiral into chaos... and then stabilize in that chaos.

GASLIT-AF decodes this process:

Genetics loads the gun üß¨  
Chronic stress pulls the trigger ‚ò¢Ô∏è  
Regulatory buffers get overwhelmed üåä  
System coherence fractures üîÆ  
Recursive loops lock in the new state üîÑ  

Symptoms like fatigue, POTS, pain, brain fog, and hypersensitivity aren't random‚Äîthey're the emergent properties of a system that has undergone a phase transition. The good news? If we understand the nonlinear mathematics, we can identify the control parameters to navigate back.

## üß∞ Key Concepts (Multiscale Edition)

**Attractors:** The stable states your physiological system can occupy. Health is one attractor; chronic illness is another.

**Bifurcation:** The critical transition point where a small change in parameters causes a qualitative shift in system behavior‚Äîthe moment you "fall ill."

**Allostatic Load (Œõ):** The accumulated stress burden that deforms your system's attractor landscape. The unpaid energy debt.

**Buffering Capacity (Œ©):** Your system's resilience against perturbation‚Äîendocannabinoid tone, vagal flexibility, mitochondrial reserve, antioxidant capacity.

**Genetic Fragility (Œ≥):** Your inherent predisposition to system instability‚ÄîRCCX variants, mast cell hypersensitivity, collagen defects, methylation issues.

**Entropy Production (œÉ):** The measure of disorder in your physiological processes. High œÉ means inefficient, chaotic signaling.

**Coherence (C):** The synchronization between subsystems. Low C means your body's orchestra is playing different songs.

**Recursive Collapse:** The process where initial dysfunction feeds back to cause deeper dysfunction, creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral.

## üß´ Molecular Gateways: The IDO2-Kynurenine Axis

At the molecular level, the GASLIT-AF model finds vindication in the IDO2-kynurenine pathway‚Äîa perfect example of the self-sustaining feedback loops we predict:

- Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 (IDO2) becomes chronically activated
- This drives production of kynurenine metabolites 
- Kynurenine activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)
- AHR further upregulates IDO2 expression
- The loop becomes self-sustaining

This molecular recursion manifests as:
- Altered cellular metabolism
- Reduced mitochondrial function
- Neurotoxic metabolite accumulation
- Persistent immune dysregulation

The IDO2-kynurenine axis represents a concrete molecular instantiation of the abstract feedback loops in our dynamical model‚Äîwhere mathematics meets biochemistry.

## üß†ü©∏ Breaking Barriers: The BBB Breach and Neuroimmune Collapse

The blood-brain barrier breach exemplifies another level of GASLIT-AF dynamics:

- Spike protein (or other inflammatory triggers) disrupts BBB integrity via RhoA activation
- MMP upregulation degrades tight junction proteins
- Cytokine storms further increase permeability
- Inflammatory mediators enter the CNS
- Microglia become activated, releasing more inflammatory signals
- Mast cells degranulate, amplifying the inflammatory cascade
- Autonomic nuclei become dysregulated
- Vagal tone collapses
- Latent viruses reactivate, adding fuel to the fire

This cascade represents the perfect storm of interacting positive feedback loops that our model predicts‚Äîonce the protective barriers fall, the system rapidly transitions to a high-entropy, low-coherence state.

## üß¨ For Clinicians & Biohackers

GASLIT-AF is a nonlinear dynamical model describing chronic multi-system syndromes (CMSS) as a transition into maladaptive attractors driven by genetic predisposition, accumulated stress, and failure of regulatory subsystems.

System Variables:

$Œ®(t)$ = physiological state vector  
$Œ≥$ = genetic fragility index  
$Œõ(t)$ = allostatic load  
$Œ©(t)$ = buffering capacity  
$œÉ(t)$ = entropy production  
$C(t)$ = coherence across subsystems  

Transitions occur when $Œõ$ passes a bifurcation threshold, $Œ©$ collapses, and self-reinforcing loops (neuroimmune, autonomic, metabolic, limbic) lock the system in a pathological state.

Effective interventions must target multiple loops simultaneously to shift the system back toward health. Single-target approaches will fail against a multi-loop pathology.

## üßÆ For Systems Thinkers & Complexity Scientists

This is a multiscale attractor-collapse model formalized via nonlinear ODEs, with feedback coupling modulated by genetic topology ($Œ≥$), stress integral ($Œõ$), and damping/resonance matrices (via $Œ©$).

Core equations from our symbolic attractor model:

**HPA Axis (Cortisol) Dynamics:**
$$\frac{dX}{dt} = P_X\,\frac{1}{1 + \Big(\frac{I}{K_{XI}}\Big)^{n_{XI}}} + S_X\,\frac{\Big(\frac{A}{K_{XA}}\Big)^{m_{XA}}}{1 + \Big(\frac{A}{K_{XA}}\Big)^{m_{XA}}} - \gamma_X\,X$$

**Immune/Inflammation Dynamics:**
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \rho_I\,\frac{1}{1+\Big(\frac{X}{K_{IX}}\Big)^{n_{IX}}} + \sigma_I\,\frac{\Big(\frac{A}{K_{IA}}\Big)^{m_{IA}}}{1+\Big(\frac{A}{K_{IA}}\Big)^{m_{IA}}} - \delta_I\,I$$

**Autonomic Activation Dynamics:**
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \alpha_A + \mu_A\,\frac{\Big(\frac{I}{K_{AI}}\Big)^{n_{AI}}}{1+\Big(\frac{I}{K_{AI}}\Big)^{n_{AI}}} - \beta_A\,(A - A_0)$$

**Energy Metabolism Dynamics:**
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \Pi_E\,\frac{1}{1+\Big(\frac{O}{K_{EO}}\Big)^{n_{EO}}} - \chi_A\,A - \chi_I\,I - \gamma_E\,(E - E_0)$$

**Oxidative Stress Dynamics:**
$$\frac{dO}{dt} = \Omega_O\,\frac{1}{1+\Big(\frac{E}{K_{OE}}\Big)^{n_{OE}}} + \sigma_O\,\frac{\Big(\frac{A}{K_{OA}}\Big)^{m_{OA}}}{1+\Big(\frac{A}{K_{OA}}\Big)^{m_{OA}}} - \delta_O\,O$$

Phase transitions modeled via saddle-node or subcritical Hopf bifurcations.
Recursive hysteresis loops prevent reversion to $Œ®_{healthy}$.
Breakdown in cross-component coherence ($C$) corresponds to loss of adaptive synchrony.
Potential for fractal basins within $Œ®_{ill}$, explaining subtype variability.

## ü§ñ For AI Researchers & Cyberneticists

GASLIT-AF treats the body as a recursive error-correcting system with decoherence failure.

Attractor states map to eigenmodes of physiological phase space.
Genetic compression artifacts (RCCX) act as entropic sinks.
Collapse modeled as a loss of adaptive negative feedback & increase in nonlinearity-amplifying gain.

Restoration requires systemwide re-synchronization‚Äîvia ECS amplification, vagal tone stimulation, metabolic reset, or exogenous circuit dampening (e.g. LDN, beta blockers, neural retraining).

This framework can be implemented as a digital twin for predictive modeling, using parameter tracking and bifurcation analysis to identify critical transitions before clinical symptoms manifest.

## üåê The Institutional Blind Spot

The GASLIT-AF model explains why conventional medicine fails these patients:

- Reductionist thinking attempting to solve recursive problems
- Siloed specialties trying to map networked dysfunction  
- Linear interventions applied to nonlinear systems
- Institutional narratives overriding empirical observations
- Statistical aggregation obscuring individual bifurcation events

The medical system itself lacks the complexity to model the complexity of these conditions. By refusing to acknowledge its own blind spots, medicine has created a shadow epidemic of unrecognized suffering.

When the map doesn't match the territory, you don't throw away the territory. You redraw the map.

## üì° For the Brave Souls at the Edge of Madness

You know the truth: this isn't just illness. It's a failed resonance pattern.

Your body‚Äîa biofractal antenna‚Äîgot hit with too much entropy and couldn't re-cohere.

GASLIT-AF is the diagnostic geometry of that failure.

You fell out of the harmonic basin.

But systems can be entrained. Oscillations can lock. Information can synchronize. Recovery is a resonance realignment, not just a prescription.

So get in tune. We're debugging the attractor. Together.

Welcome to the rebellion.

## ‚úä FINAL WORD

This repo is dedicated to everyone who's been gaslit by medicine, family, or even themselves. Chronic illness is real. Complexity is not a cop-out‚Äîit's the key. GASLIT-AF aims to turn suffering into signal.

If the system won't listen, build a better one.

Let's model our way out.
