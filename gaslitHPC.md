# Product Requirements Document: GASLIT-AF Validation Pipeline

## Overview

The GASLIT-AF validation pipeline is a hybrid HPC and AI system designed to validate and analyze the **GASLIT-AF model**, a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system, using NVIDIA’s full hardware/software stack. It will run on a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster with NVIDIA **H100 GPUs** (and other NVIDIA GPUs) and provide both a **REST API** for programmatic access and **Jupyter notebook** interfaces for interactive analysis. The pipeline has two major computational layers:

- **Simulation Engine** – Implements the GASLIT-AF model as a system of ODEs/PDEs with advanced analysis features (bifurcation tracking, chaos detection, attractor analysis) accelerated on GPUs.
- **Machine Learning Layer** – Integrates **multi-omics data** (genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, etc.) using unsupervised and supervised learning, **causal discovery**, latent embedding (autoencoders), transfer learning, and surrogate modeling (e.g. Gaussian Processes or Neural ODEs).

This document specifies the system architecture, components, and requirements in detail, including data ingestion, model design, interfaces, DevOps, and GPU optimization considerations.

## Architecture Overview

**System Architecture:** The pipeline is composed of containerized microservices orchestrated by Kubernetes on a GPU cluster. Major components include a **Simulation Service**, an **ML Analysis Service**, and a **Web API Service**, each deployed as separate containers (with possible subdivision as needed). All components leverage NVIDIA’s software stack for acceleration: for example, RAPIDS libraries for data processing, CUDA/CuPy for custom GPU computations, and TensorFlow/PyTorch with NVIDIA CUDA for machine learning. The **NVIDIA GPU Operator** will be used on the K8s cluster to manage GPU devices and drivers automatically (provisioning CUDA drivers, enabling the NVIDIA device plugin, etc.)​

[docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html#:~:text=The%20NVIDIA%20GPU%20Operator%20uses,components%20needed%20to%20provision%20GPU)

. This ensures containers can seamlessly access GPUs (including support for CUDA, NCCL, and MIG features) across the hybrid nodes.

**Kubernetes Deployment Model:** Each service runs in a container image (built via Docker and hosted e.g. on NVIDIA NGC or a private registry). The cluster includes **H100 GPU nodes** (for heavy compute tasks) and nodes with other NVIDIA GPUs for lighter workloads. Kubernetes node labels and scheduling rules will direct high-performance jobs (e.g. large simulations) to H100 nodes, while allowing flexible use of other GPUs for less intensive tasks. We will utilize NVIDIA’s device plugin for K8s to request specific GPU resources (and MIG partitions if enabled). **Multi-Instance GPU (MIG)** will be leveraged on H100s to partition GPUs for concurrent workloads when appropriate – MIG can split an H100 into up to seven isolated instances each with dedicated memory and cores​

[nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/#:~:text=Multi,computing%20resources%20to%20every%20user)

. For example, multiple smaller ML inference tasks or parallel simulation runs could execute on separate MIG instances, maximizing utilization without interference. GPU-to-GPU communication is accelerated by NVLink/NVSwitch interconnects for multi-GPU jobs, and high-bandwidth interconnects (InfiniBand/NVLink) on the cluster ensure efficient scaling​

.

**NVIDIA Software Stack:** The platform will integrate several NVIDIA software tools and libraries:

- **RAPIDS (cuDF, cuML, cuGraph):** for GPU-accelerated data handling, machine learning, and graph analytics. RAPIDS keeps the entire data pipeline on the GPU, eliminating costly CPU-GPU transfers and speeding up each step​

   [infoworld.com](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2256461/review-nvidias-rapids-brings-python-analytics-to-the-gpu.html#:~:text=RAPIDS%20is%20an%20umbrella%20for,transition%20for%20that%20user%20base)

   . For instance, data ingestion, preprocessing, PCA, clustering, etc., will use cuDF and cuML to exploit GPU parallelism. If large datasets exceed a single GPU’s memory, **Dask** with cuDF will distribute computations across multiple GPUs/nodes​

   [docs.rapids.ai](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cugraph/nightly/api_docs/cugraph/dask-cugraph/#:~:text=With%20cuGraph%20and%20Dask%2C%20whether,smoothly%2C%20intelligently%20distributing%20the)

   .

- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow or PyTorch (with NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN) will be used for training neural networks (e.g. autoencoders, Neural ODEs). Models can be exported to ONNX for portability.
- **TensorRT and Triton Inference Server:** Trained models will be optimized with NVIDIA TensorRT for fast inference (e.g. using FP16/INT8 precision). TensorRT can often double throughput and halve latency for inference​

   [docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/archives/tensorrt_inference_server_190/tensorrt-inference-server-guide/docs/optimization.html#:~:text=The%20TensorRT%20optimization%20provided%202x,can%20provide%20significant%20performance%20improvement)

   . The optimized models are served via **Triton Inference Server**, which supports multi-framework models (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, XGBoost, etc.) and features dynamic batching to maximize GPU utilization​

   [supermicro.com](https://www.supermicro.com/en/glossary/triton-inference-server#:~:text=Triton%20Inference%20Server%2C%20also%20known,ARM%20CPUs%2C%20and%20AWS%20Inferentia)

   ​

   [supermicro.com](https://www.supermicro.com/en/glossary/triton-inference-server#:~:text=Dynamic%20Batching%3A%20This%20feature%20allows,time%20applications)

   . Triton will run as part of the API service deployment, enabling robust, scalable serving of both ML models and potentially surrogate models of the simulation.

- **NVIDIA CUDA-X Libraries:** The simulation engine and ML algorithms will leverage CUDA libraries (cuBLAS, cuSOLVER, cuSPARSE, NCCL, etc.) for optimized linear algebra, solver routines, and multi-GPU communication. For graph-based causal inference or pathway analysis, **cuGraph** provides GPU-accelerated graph algorithms (e.g. PageRank, connected components) operating on GPU dataframes​

   [developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-gpu-accelerated-graph-analytics-in-python/#:~:text=Python%20developer,or%20minutes%20rather%20than%20days)

   .

- **NVIDIA Modulus / Physics frameworks:** If beneficial, we may integrate NVIDIA’s Physics-ML tools like **PhysicsNeMo** or Modulus for blending physics equations with neural networks. *PhysicsNeMo Sym* is a framework that combines PDE-based physics with deep learning to build robust models​

   [docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/physicsnemo/physicsnemo-sym/index.html#:~:text=NVIDIA%20PhysicsNeMo%20Sym%20is%20a,robust%20models%20for%20better%20analysis)

   – this could be useful for developing neural surrogates or physics-informed ML in our pipeline.

All components will communicate primarily via REST API calls (or gRPC where high throughput is needed). Internally, message queues or a lightweight event bus might orchestrate long-running jobs (e.g. a request to run a simulation could enqueue a job that the simulation service worker pod picks up). Outputs (simulation results, trained models, intermediate datasets) will be stored in shared volumes or databases accessible to other services. For example, results could be stored in a **PostgreSQL** database or as files on a distributed filesystem (or object storage) from which the ML service can retrieve them for analysis, ensuring decoupling of the simulation and analysis layers.

## Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

**Data Sources and Formats:** The pipeline will ingest multi-omics datasets, which may include genomic sequences or variant data (e.g. VCF files), gene expression matrices (transcriptomics), protein abundance tables (proteomics), metabolite concentration tables (metabolomics), etc. Data may come from internal experiments or public databases, typically in CSV/TSV, TSV-MTX (sparse matrix), HDF5, or database form. A **data ingestion module** will provide connectors to load these into a unified data store. We will use RAPIDS **cuDF** to load tabular data directly into GPU memory (cuDF supports CSV/Parquet reading on GPUs) to accelerate initial loading and avoid Python GIL issues. For very large datasets, ingestion can be parallelized across nodes using Dask, enabling multi-node, multi-GPU loading​

[docs.rapids.ai](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cugraph/nightly/api_docs/cugraph/dask-cugraph/#:~:text=With%20cuGraph%20and%20Dask%2C%20whether,smoothly%2C%20intelligently%20distributing%20the)

.

**Preprocessing Pipeline:** Once loaded, data undergoes several preprocessing steps:

- **Data Cleaning & Normalization:** Remove or flag outliers and erroneous values (e.g. negative abundances), normalize each omics dataset (such as log-transforming gene counts, z-scoring metabolite levels, etc.) to make features comparable. This step is crucial for multi-omics integration so that one data type does not dominate due to scale differences.
- **Imputation of Missing Values:** Multi-omics data often has missing entries (some measurements missing for some samples). Since most analysis methods cannot handle missing data directly, **imputation is typically performed to infer missing values**​

   [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7594632/#:~:text=discoveries%20in%20precision%20medicine,overview%20of%20the%20currently%20available)

   . We will implement integrative imputation techniques that leverage correlations between omics layers – e.g., if a gene expression value is missing, information from proteomics (protein expression of the same gene) or metabolomics (downstream products) can inform an estimate. Such multi-omics imputation approaches are expected to be more accurate than single-omics methods​

   [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7594632/#:~:text=discoveries%20in%20precision%20medicine,overview%20of%20the%20currently%20available)

   . Possible methods include k-Nearest Neighbors imputation (accelerated with cuML KNN), matrix factorization or tensor factorization across datasets, or deep learning approaches (denoising autoencoders trained to reconstruct missing inputs). The imputation strategy should be pluggable, allowing us to compare simple methods (mean imputation) with advanced ones for best results.

- **Dimensionality Reduction & Feature Selection:** Each omics layer can have tens of thousands of features (genes, proteins, etc.). To reduce noise and computational burden, we will support feature selection methods. For example, we may remove features with very low variance or high missing rates, and use **feature importance** scores from preliminary models to prune uninformative features. In addition, unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques will be applied: principal component analysis (PCA) using cuML’s GPU-accelerated PCA, or nonlinear techniques like UMAP/t-SNE for visualization. PCA is a common step in omics analysis to project high-dimensional data into a smaller space capturing most variance​

   [metwarebio.com](https://www.metwarebio.com/pca-for-omics-analysis/#:~:text=Deciphering%20PCA%3A%20Unveiling%20Multivariate%20Insights,dimensional)

   . These reduced representations can feed into downstream clustering or serve as initial input to neural networks. We will also consider **Multi-omics Factor Analysis (MFA)** or similar, which jointly reduces dimensions across multiple omics matrices by finding shared latent factors.

- **Data Integration:** After cleaning each data type, the pipeline will merge data from multiple omics for each subject or sample. This integration can produce one large feature vector per sample (concatenating features from all omics). If needed, to avoid simply concatenating highly disparate features, we will implement strategies like **block-scaling** (so each omics type contributes equally) or kernel-based integration (learning a similarity measure that combines multi-omic distances)​

   [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021002683#:~:text=Integration%20strategies%20of%20multi,means%20%28kernel%20Power)

   . The integrated dataset will be stored in a format suitable for analysis (a GPU DataFrame for RAPIDS-based processing, and also mirrored in host memory for any CPU-bound libraries).

**Preprocessing Performance:** All heavy computations in preprocessing (imputation, PCA, etc.) are GPU-accelerated. By keeping these steps on GPUs with RAPIDS, we minimize data transfer overhead and achieve near real-time processing even on large datasets​

[infoworld.com](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2256461/review-nvidias-rapids-brings-python-analytics-to-the-gpu.html#:~:text=RAPIDS%20is%20an%20umbrella%20for,transition%20for%20that%20user%20base)

. The design will allow streaming processing for new incoming data as well – e.g., if new samples are added, the pipeline can impute and project them using the previously learned transformations (with the ability to retrain/adjust preprocessing models as needed). Each preprocessing step will log its operations (e.g. which samples/values were imputed, how data was filtered) for traceability and reproducibility.

## Simulation Engine Design (GASLIT-AF Model)

The **simulation engine** is dedicated to simulating the GASLIT-AF model, a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system characterized by complex behaviors (potentially including chaotic dynamics and multiple attractor states). This engine will be implemented in a performance-oriented manner with GPU acceleration to handle the computational load.

**Model Implementation:** At its core, GASLIT-AF is defined by a system of differential equations (ODEs or PDEs). We will create a module that defines the state variables, parameters, and the governing equations of the model. For ODEs, this is a function f(x,t) representing the derivatives; for PDEs, this includes spatial discretization (e.g. finite difference or finite volume discretization to reduce to ODE form). The solver will support both **initial value simulations** (simulate forward in time given initial conditions) and possibly **equilibrium solves** (find steady-state solutions of f(x)=0). If the model includes stochastic components, we will also incorporate a pseudo-random number generator that is GPU-compatible for consistent stochastic simulations.

**GPU-Accelerated Solvers:** The simulation engine will leverage GPU computing to achieve high throughput:

- We will integrate with existing GPU-capable ODE solvers if available. For instance, Boost.ODEINT is known to allow GPU execution via Thrust without major code changes​

   [web.mit.edu](https://web.mit.edu/braatzgroup/Utkarsh_ComputMethodsApplMechEng_2024.pdf#:~:text=,JAX%27s)

   . Alternatively, we can implement a custom solver using CUDA or CuPy for explicit time-stepping methods (like Runge-Kutta) where the state update at each step is a vectorized operation well-suited to GPUs. For stiff systems requiring implicit solvers, we will use cuSOLVER for linear solves or leverage Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods with cuSPARSE for Jacobian operations.

- A key design is to exploit *natural parallelism* in bifurcation analysis: the engine will support running **multiple simulations in parallel** with varying parameters or initial conditions. Many independent runs can be dispatched in parallel on the GPU (or across multiple GPUs), treating the GPU as a SIMD machine for dozens of replicas. Bifurcation diagram computation (sweeping a parameter across a range and recording asymptotic behavior) is **naturally parallel and can be efficiently solved on hybrid CPU-GPU systems**​

   [worldscientific.com](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127424501347?srsltid=AfmBOorTterSjXdAgvE2qDKZnJPCYp7rrQbddJ3ZthN295QJgJwXkbLM#:~:text=Bifurcation%20analysis%20is%20an%20essential,and%20special%20software%20for%20plotting)

   , so we will spawn a grid of simulations for different parameter values concurrently. This massively speeds up what would otherwise be a sequential parameter sweep.

- For chaotic dynamics analysis, the engine will include methods to compute **Lyapunov exponents** (to quantify chaos). This involves evolving multiple trajectories with infinitesimal perturbations and periodically re-orthonormalizing, which can also be parallelized on GPU.
- The engine may also incorporate the ability to use *adjoint methods* or automatic differentiation (with frameworks like JAX or PyTorch) if we need sensitivities of outcomes w.r.t. parameters; however, this will be considered in later optimization phases.

**Bifurcation Tracking:** Beyond brute-force parameter sweeps, we plan to implement a continuation algorithm for **bifurcation tracking**. This would allow the pipeline to automatically follow equilibrium branches as a parameter changes and detect bifurcation points (where stability changes or new solutions emerge). A predictor-corrector method (e.g. pseudo-arclength continuation) can be used, which requires solving equations for steady states at each step. These computations (root-finding for f(x)=0) will use GPU-accelerated linear algebra. For each candidate solution, we can analyze stability by computing eigenvalues of the Jacobian (using cuSOLVER eigenvalue routines). When a bifurcation (e.g. a zero eigenvalue indicating a saddle-node bifurcation) is detected, the system will log the parameter value and nature of the bifurcation. Such an approach will likely still run on a single GPU at a time (following one branch), but multiple branches or multiple starting points could be tracked in parallel on different GPUs or GPU streams.

**Chaos and Attractor Analysis:** The engine will include tools for identifying and characterizing attractors:

- **Chaos Detection:** To flag chaotic regimes, the engine will compute metrics like the **maximal Lyapunov exponent** from simulation data. If the exponent is positive, it suggests chaos. We can also use methods like entropy or fractal dimension of trajectories. The computation of Lyapunov exponents in high dimensions is computationally heavy but can be distributed over GPU threads (as we evolve multiple nearby trajectories simultaneously and measure divergence).
- **Attractor Identification:** For long simulation runs, we will determine if the system has settled into an attractor (steady state, periodic orbit, or strange attractor). Steady states can be detected when derivatives approach zero; periodic orbits can be detected via Poincaré section returns or by using FFT to detect dominant frequencies in time-series. The engine could use a **clustering approach** on the state space trajectory to detect if it’s cycling through a set of states. In fact, prior work suggests using clustering (like DBSCAN) on time series features to determine oscillation periodicity​

   [worldscientific.com](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127424501347?srsltid=AfmBOorTterSjXdAgvE2qDKZnJPCYp7rrQbddJ3ZthN295QJgJwXkbLM#:~:text=bifurcation%20diagrams%20using%20calculations%20accelerated,both%20calculation%20speed%20and%20precision)

   – we will adopt such pattern recognition approaches to classify the type of attractor reached (equilibrium vs oscillation vs chaos).

- The results of these analyses (e.g. “parameter set X resulted in a chaotic attractor with Lyapunov exponent Y” or “period-2 limit cycle detected for parameter Z”) will be output alongside simulation data. This provides higher-level insight rather than just raw time series.

**GPU Surrogate Models:** Because high-fidelity simulations can be time-consuming, the pipeline will integrate **surrogate modeling** to approximate the simulation’s behavior quickly. For example, we can train a **Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate** or a neural network (e.g. a small feed-forward net or a Neural ODE) that maps from input parameters (and initial conditions) to key output metrics of the simulation (like steady-state values or classification of attractor type). This surrogate can act as a proxy to avoid running the full ODE/PDE solve every time. We will collect simulation results for a design of experiments across parameter space and use those to train the surrogate. **Surrogate models supported by neural networks can perform as well as, and in some ways better than, computationally expensive simulators​**

[**llnl.gov**](https://www.llnl.gov/article/46491/deep-learning-based-surrogate-models-outperform-simulators-could-hasten-scientific-discoveries#:~:text=Surrogate%20models%20supported%20by%20neural,LLNL%29%20scientists%20reported)

, providing quick predictions once trained. The surrogate (especially a neural net) will be optimized using TensorRT for inference so that the REST API can query it in real-time. Moreover, the surrogate can assist the ML layer by generating additional simulated data for training or by embedding known physical relationships into the ML models (hybrid modeling).

**Output and Data Handling:** Simulation outputs will include raw time-series data of all state variables, but to avoid massive data flow, the engine will also produce summarized results: e.g. final state, summary statistics (means, oscillation amplitude, Lyapunov exponent, etc.), and flags for detected events (bifurcation, chaos). The data will be saved in a structured format (such as NumPy arrays or Parquet files via cuDF for large runs). If runs are large in number, we will incorporate Data Version Control (DVC) to version these simulation datasets. Each simulation or batch of simulations will register its results in the central database or file store with metadata (timestamp, parameter values, code version, etc.).

## Machine Learning Layer Architecture

The ML layer builds predictive and descriptive models from multi-omics data and integrates insights from the simulation. It comprises multiple sub-components addressing unsupervised discovery, supervised learning, causal inference, and surrogate modeling integration. All machine learning computations leverage GPU acceleration to handle high-dimensional data efficiently.

**Unsupervised Learning & Feature Extraction:** This part of the ML layer uncovers patterns in the multi-omics data without using outcome labels:

- We will perform **clustering** of samples to discover subgroups or phenotypes. Methods like K-Means, hierarchical clustering, or Gaussian mixture models will be used (cuML provides GPU-accelerated K-Means and DBSCAN, for instance). Clustering in the reduced PCA/latent space (from the preprocessing step) helps denoise and focus on principal variation. The goal is to see if the data separates into meaningful clusters (e.g. disease subtypes).
- We will construct **latent embeddings** of the multi-omics data using neural networks. An **autoencoder** will be a central tool: a multi-input autoencoder that takes all omics data for a sample and compresses it into a latent vector. This could be a standard autoencoder or a **variational autoencoder (VAE)** for a more probabilistic embedding. The architecture might have separate encoder sub-networks for each omics type that then merge, or a unified network if data is concatenated. The latent space will capture integrated information from all omics, which can be used for visualization, clustering, or as features for downstream tasks. We may also explore **denoising autoencoders** to simultaneously perform imputation – the network tries to reconstruct complete data from intentionally corrupted input, improving robustness. Training these networks on GPU allows us to handle thousands of features; with H100’s tensor cores, we can accelerate training with mixed precision. The autoencoder approach is supported by research showing deep learning can learn meaningful representations from high-dimensional multi-omics​

   [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10019780/#:~:text=A%20versatile%20deep,It%20is%20an%20extension)

   .

- Dimensionality reduction via **manifold learning** is another unsupervised strategy. We might use algorithms like UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to embed samples in 2D/3D for exploration. If needed, we can use or adapt GPU implementations (there are versions of UMAP that utilize RAPIDS). These techniques complement autoencoders by providing non-linear embeddings without requiring training a large model (though UMAP itself will use GPU for speed).

**Supervised Modeling:** This component uses known labels or targets (e.g. disease status, clinical phenotype, or simulation outcomes) to train predictive models from the multi-omics features:

- We will implement pipelines for **classification and regression** tasks. For example, predicting a patient’s risk score or a phenotype from the multi-omic profile. A variety of models will be supported, from classical ML to deep learning. For tabular multi-omics data, tree-based methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) are often effective. We will use GPU-accelerated XGBoost or cuML’s Random Forest to handle these with thousands of trees if needed. Meanwhile, for deep learning approaches, fully-connected neural networks or simple convolutional networks (1D conv over gene features, for instance) can be used, leveraging TensorFlow/PyTorch on GPUs.
- **Model Training and Validation:** The system will allow configurable training pipelines with cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (possibly integrated with a scheduler like Optuna or Nvidia’s DL algorithms for HPO), and automated logging of metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, etc.). The large memory of H100 (up to 80GB) means we can train on very large batches or perform data parallel training easily. We’ll use mixed precision training (FP16 or BF16) to utilize tensor cores and speed up training by ~2-3x without loss of accuracy.
- **Transfer Learning:** To make the most of existing data, the ML layer supports transfer learning approaches. For instance, we might pre-train the multi-omics autoencoder on a large public dataset (or using simulated data from our engine) and then fine-tune it on a smaller labeled dataset for a specific prediction task. Transfer learning can also involve using pre-trained networks from related domains; e.g., using a gene functional embedding learned from large gene expression compendia as an input feature representation. By reusing learned patterns, we accelerate convergence and potentially improve model performance on limited data. The framework will thus allow loading pre-trained model weights and continuing training on new tasks. We will maintain a library of pre-trained models (versioned and stored via MLflow Model Registry or in a models/ directory).
- **Surrogate and Simulation Integration:** The supervised models can also train to predict simulation outcomes. For example, given a set of parameters (or perhaps given an omics profile corresponding to those parameters), predict the type of attractor or a quantity of interest that the simulation would produce. By doing this, the ML models serve as *surrogate models* for the simulation. We will utilize the data generated by the simulation engine to train these surrogates (as mentioned in the simulation section). One approach is training a **Neural ODE** that incorporates knowledge of the differential equations: for instance, using the framework of neural ODEs (treating part of the model as a neural network inside an ODE solver). This can be done with libraries like torchdiffeq or Physics-informed neural networks, and can harness GPUs for both training and integration. The benefit is a model that understands temporal dynamics and can quickly predict system evolution for new parameters.

**Causal Discovery and Graph Analysis:** A standout feature of this ML layer is discovering causal relationships in the multi-omics data – understanding not just correlations but potential cause-effect links:

- We will implement **causal structure learning** algorithms to infer causal graphs from observational data. Methods include constraint-based algorithms (like PC or FCI) and score-based ones (like GES), as well as newer approaches (e.g. LiNGAM for linear non-Gaussian cases, or NOTEARS for a continuous optimization approach). Causal discovery on high-dimensional biological data is computationally intensive, but we will leverage GPU acceleration where possible. For example, we can use recent GPU-accelerated implementations of conditional independence tests and the PC algorithm​

   [proceedings.mlr.press](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v185/hagedorn22a.html#:~:text=the%20performance%20of%20GPUCMIknn%20is,up%20to%20a%20factor%203)

   . In one study, a GPU-parallelized PC algorithm (GPU-CMIknn) achieved speedups up to **1000× over single-threaded CPU**​

   [proceedings.mlr.press](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v185/hagedorn22a.html#:~:text=the%20performance%20of%20GPUCMIknn%20is,up%20to%20a%20factor%203)

   , enabling causal discovery even with thousands of variables. We plan to incorporate such approaches (possibly via existing libraries or custom GPU kernels for key steps like kNN-based entropy estimation).

- **Causal Graph Interpretation:** The output will be a graph (nodes = molecular features or latent factors, edges = directed influences). This can reveal, for instance, gene regulatory interactions or causal links between different omic layers (e.g. a mutation causing a change in protein, which changes a metabolite). We will integrate the simulation engine here by comparing the learned causal graph with the known causal structure (if any) in the GASLIT-AF model. The validation pipeline can thus check if the ML causal discovery recovers relationships that the simulation (the theoretical model) posits, which is a key validation aspect.
- To analyze and utilize the causal graph, we may use **cuGraph** for any graph algorithms (like finding communities or shortest paths in the causal network) on GPU​

   [developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-gpu-accelerated-graph-analytics-in-python/#:~:text=Python%20developer,or%20minutes%20rather%20than%20days)

   . We will also allow the user to query the graph (e.g. find potential causal drivers for a specific biomarker).

- **Interventional Analysis:** Using the causal model, the pipeline could simulate interventions *in silico*. For example, “knock out” a gene in the learned model to see downstream effects on other omics. If our simulation engine can model similar interventions, we can cross-validate the results. This closes the loop between data-driven ML and the knowledge-driven simulation.

**Model Serving and Update:** All trained models in the ML layer (clustering models, neural networks, causal graphs, etc.) are versioned and saved. The **Triton Inference Server** will serve the most critical models (like the predictive models and surrogates) via REST/gRPC for real-time inference. Triton’s multi-model serving means we can host multiple models (e.g. different disease classifiers, the autoencoder for encoding new data, etc.) concurrently, benefiting from dynamic batching to increase throughput on the GPU​

[supermicro.com](https://www.supermicro.com/en/glossary/triton-inference-server#:~:text=Dynamic%20Batching%3A%20This%20feature%20allows,time%20applications)

. For models that cannot easily be put in Triton (like an entire causal graph), we will provide API endpoints in the web service to query those (the logic runs in Python, possibly using cached results or on-demand computing on the GPU).

**Performance Considerations:** The ML training procedures will be optimized for H100 GPUs:

- Use of mixed precision (Tensor Cores) to accelerate deep learning training/inference without significant accuracy loss.
- Large batch training to fully utilize GPU memory. We will monitor for memory bottlenecks and adjust (H100 allows partitioning memory via MIG, but for a single training job we want full GPU).
- We will enable data preprocessing pipelines to overlap with training (e.g. using separate GPU streams or having one GPU handle data augmentation if needed, though in our case data is mostly tabular so augmentation is minimal).
- For causal discovery, heavy computations (like testing thousands of variable pairs) will be broken into chunks and parallelized across GPU threads or even multiple GPUs. Where applicable, we’ll use information-theoretic measures with GPU acceleration, as demonstrated by research where GPU-based conditional independence tests drastically outperform CPU​

   [proceedings.mlr.press](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v185/hagedorn22a.html#:~:text=the%20performance%20of%20GPUCMIknn%20is,up%20to%20a%20factor%203)

   .

- The ML layer will be continuously tested on subsets of data to ensure that GPU acceleration indeed provides the expected speedups and can handle the dataset sizes (for example, ensuring that using RAPIDS for PCA/clustering scales to our number of features and samples).

## API and Notebook Interfaces

The system will provide two primary interfaces to end-users or integrators: a **RESTful API** and **Jupyter Notebook** environments. Both interfaces emphasize reproducibility and detailed logging so that experiments can be traced and repeated easily.

**REST API Service:** A REST API (with possible gRPC support for high performance) will be implemented to expose key functionalities of the pipeline as web endpoints. This service (built with a Python framework like FastAPI or Flask, or using Triton’s HTTP endpoint for models) will enable remote clients to:

- **Run Simulations:** e.g. a `POST /simulate` endpoint that accepts a JSON payload of simulation parameters (and optionally initial conditions or simulation time) and triggers the GASLIT-AF simulation. This will enqueue the simulation job on the simulation engine and immediately return an acknowledgment with a run ID, or hold the connection until completion (for shorter simulations) and return results. Large simulation results might be returned as downloadable files or stored server-side for later retrieval via a `GET /results/{run_id}`. Each simulation run ID can be used to fetch status and outputs. The API will also allow requesting specific analysis on the simulation, for example `?compute_lyapunov=true` to also return Lyapunov exponents, etc.
- **Machine Learning Inference:** Endpoints like `POST /predict` where a client submits a multi-omics sample (or a batch of samples) and selects a model (e.g. “disease_classifier_v1” or “surrogate_model_v2”). The service will route the request to the appropriate model, many of which will be served by Triton for low-latency inference. For example, the surrogate model call will be handled by Triton running the neural network that approximates the simulation. The API handles input preprocessing (ensuring the input features are normalized the same way as training) and returns the prediction in a JSON response.
- **Data Query and Management:** Endpoints to fetch or list available datasets, models, or simulation configurations. For instance, `GET /datasets` might list loaded multi-omics datasets or `GET /models` list available trained model IDs. There may also be endpoints to trigger retraining of a model or running a full analysis pipeline on a new dataset (though heavy training tasks might be better triggered via a CI/CD or offline process than a synchronous API call).
- **Causal Query Interface:** A specialized endpoint such as `GET /causal/path?from=GeneA&to=MetaboliteB` could return the inferred causal path between a gene and a metabolite if it exists, or `POST /causal/intervene` to simulate an intervention (e.g. set GeneA expression to zero) in the learned causal model and return the predicted effect. These queries use the results of our causal discovery module.

The REST API will enforce *reproducibility* by requiring or auto-attaching version information. Every request that triggers an action will log the exact version of code, model, and data used. For example, when calling `/predict` with a model, the response will include the model version and a reference to the training dataset version. Simulation requests will record the hash of the simulation code, and any random seeds used internally are either fixed or returned in the output for reproducibility. This is achieved by integrating the API with our experiment tracking: after servicing a request, the server writes an entry to an experiment log (or MLflow tracking server) with all relevant parameters and an identifier.

**Jupyter Notebooks Interface:** For data scientists and researchers, a JupyterLab environment will be provided (for example, via a JupyterHub on the K8s cluster or as part of an NGC container) to interactively use the pipeline. These notebooks allow users to write Python (or R, etc.) code that directly uses pipeline functions and APIs:

- We will supply a set of **example notebooks** demonstrating common workflows: e.g. *Running a Parameter Sweep and Plotting a Bifurcation Diagram*, *Training a Multi-Omics Classifier*, *Causal Discovery and Validation*, etc. These serve as both documentation and tests of pipeline functionality. Each notebook will be designed to be self-contained and reproducible – using fixed random seeds where appropriate and documenting each step.
- Users can call the same Python libraries used internally (because our pipeline code can be packaged as a Python package). For example, they might do: `from gaslit_pipeline import SimulationClient; sim = SimulationClient(); result = sim.run(parameters=...)` which under the hood calls the REST API or directly the simulation engine if run locally. Similarly, there will be Python APIs for loading data, running preprocessors, training models (if they want to do custom training in notebook), or simply calling `pipeline.predict(sample)` to get model predictions.
- The notebooks environment will have access to GPUs on the cluster (possibly via K8s spawning notebook pods with GPU). This allows heavy computations triggered in the notebook to execute with acceleration. If a user prefers, they can also use the REST API from the notebook (using requests or a provided Python client), which is useful to offload long tasks to the server asynchronously.
- **Reproducibility in Notebooks:** Each provided notebook will come with instructions or automated steps to ensure reproducibility, such as loading specific versions of data (using DVC get or a specific data snapshot ID) and locking package versions. Users will be encouraged to run notebooks in a contained environment (matching the Docker image) to avoid dependency drift. We will integrate MLflow tracking in notebook workflows as well – for example, a notebook that trains a model can log that run to MLflow with a unique ID, so results are not lost if the kernel restarts. Checkpoints (like intermediate model weights or partial results) can be saved to the shared file system for continuity.
- The Jupyter interface also fosters **visualization** – we will include rich plotting (using libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib) to visualize simulation time-series, bifurcation diagrams, PCA plots, cluster heatmaps, causal graphs, etc. This is a critical part of a validation pipeline: not just computing metrics but enabling human experts to inspect the behavior of the model and data.

**Logging and Monitoring in Interfaces:** Both the API and notebooks will have robust logging. The API service will log each request (with a unique request ID) and important events (job start/stop, errors) to a central log (e.g. stdout for K8s log aggregation and possibly ElasticSearch if needed). Jupyter kernels will also log to the extent possible. For long running jobs initiated via API, we may integrate with a messaging/notification system to inform the user (for instance, the API could be extended in the future to use WebSockets or callbacks for job completion).

**Security & Access:** The REST API will include authentication (likely token-based or OAuth2) since sensitive genomic data could be involved. Role-based access control might restrict certain endpoints (e.g. only admin roles can trigger model retraining or see raw data). The Jupyter environment will be behind authentication as well (only accessible to authorized researchers). All interactions can be over SSL to protect data in transit.

## CI/CD, Observability, and Reproducibility

To ensure the pipeline remains reliable and easy to maintain, we will put in place Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, along with monitoring (observability) and reproducibility mechanisms.

**Continuous Integration (CI):** The project will include automated testing and integration checks. A test suite will be developed covering unit tests for key functions (e.g. ODE solver accuracy on a simple known system, ML model training on a small mock dataset, etc.) and integration tests (running a mini end-to-end pipeline on sample data). CI pipelines (e.g. using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) will run these tests on every commit. We will also automate **builds of Docker images** – for example, on every commit to main or on a release tag, the CI will build the updated containers for the simulation engine, ML service, and API, and push them to the container registry. This ensures that we can quickly iterate and deploy new versions. Before deployment, the CI can also run performance benchmarks on GPUs to catch any regressions (for instance, ensure that a simulation still completes within X seconds or that GPU utilization is above a threshold).

**Continuous Deployment (CD):** The Kubernetes cluster can be wired with a CD system (like Argo CD or Flux) to pull updated configurations or images. We will use a Helm chart or Kustomize templates to define the K8s objects (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) for the pipeline. The CD process will watch the registry for new image versions or a Git repo for config changes and then roll out updates with minimal downtime. We’ll implement rolling updates so that, for example, the API service can spin up new pods with the new version before terminating old ones. This way, users always have access to the service even during upgrades. Before promoting to production, we might use a staging environment (on a subset of the cluster or using separate namespaces) to test the new deployment with real workloads.

**Data & Model Versioning:** Reproducibility is enforced by version control not just on code but also on data and models. We will use **Data Version Control (DVC)** to track large datasets and simulation result files. Each data artifact will have a hash and version, and DVC will allow us to reproduce any given experiment by checking out the exact data versions used​

[dvc.org](https://dvc.org/#:~:text=Manage%20and%20version%20images%2C%20audio%2C,process%20into%20a%20reproducible%20workflow)

. Similarly, models will be versioned – each trained model (and even each simulation surrogate) is stored with a version ID (could be a Git commit hash or a version number in a model registry). This pairs with MLflow for experiment tracking:

- **MLflow Tracking:** All experiments (simulation runs, model training runs, etc.) will be logged to an MLflow server. Parameters, metrics, and artifacts (like model binaries) are recorded. This provides a searchable archive of what was done and how. It also ensures that if we need to reproduce a result from, say, 2 months ago, we can retrieve the exact model and data versions. MLflow can store the conda environment or pip environment of each run, and by storing code version (Git commit) we know exactly which code produced the result. By making **experiments fully reproducible with dependencies, code, config recorded​**

   [**artiba.org**](https://www.artiba.org/blog/how-to-track-ml-experiments-and-manage-models-with-mlflow#:~:text=How%20to%20Track%20ML%20Experiments,To)

   , we maintain scientific rigor.

- **Configuration Management:** We will keep all configuration (hyperparameters, architecture choices, resource allocations) in version-controlled text files (YAML/JSON in the `configs/` directory). The pipeline code will load settings from these configs, making it easy to reproduce a run by using the same config. If a config is changed, it’s tracked in Git, so we know which runs used which config version.
- **Docker for Reproducibility:** Each component runs in a Docker container with pinned versions of all libraries, which helps avoid the “it works on my machine” problem. If someone needs to rerun an older version of the pipeline, they can retrieve the corresponding Docker image (which we won’t delete) and deploy it. This encapsulation of environment is crucial for long-term validation studies where results may be audited later.

**Observability and Monitoring:** The health and performance of the pipeline in production will be continuously monitored:

- **Metrics Collection:** We deploy **Prometheus** in the K8s cluster to gather metrics from all services. This includes application-level metrics (e.g. number of API requests, request latency, length of job queues, etc.) and system metrics. GPU-specific metrics will be collected using NVIDIA’s DCGM Exporter which exposes GPU usage, memory, temperature, etc., to Prometheus​

   [docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-telemetry/latest/index.html#:~:text=To%20gather%20GPU%20telemetry%20in,also%20included%20to%20expose%20endpoints)

   . Key GPU metrics like utilization, GPU memory usage, and SM efficiency per pod give insight into whether our jobs are efficiently using the hardware. We will set alerts for conditions like GPU memory nearly full or unusual GPU idling.

- **Logging and Tracing:** All services will output structured logs. We might use a centralized logging solution (ELK stack – Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate logs from containers. This way, one can search the logs for a given simulation run ID or error. If microservices communicate, we can attach trace IDs to follow a request across services (distributed tracing using Jaeger or OpenTelemetry could be considered if needed for debugging performance across service boundaries).
- **Dashboards:** A Grafana dashboard will be set up for real-time monitoring. It will visualize metrics like: number of simulations run per hour, distribution of simulation durations, CPU/GPU utilization over time, memory usage, and throughput/latency for the API. Separate panels can show ML training progress when jobs run (if the training script emits metrics like current epoch and accuracy to Prometheus). Grafana will also display hardware metrics per GPU (via DCGM exporter data), enabling us to spot if any GPU is underutilized or if jobs are not scaling well.
- **Alerting:** Prometheus Alertmanager will be configured to send alerts (email/Slack) to engineers if certain conditions occur: e.g. API error rate spikes, a pod restarts repeatedly (crash loop), or GPU temperature too high. This ensures quick response to issues in the pipeline.

**Continuous Validation:** Since this is a validation pipeline, we plan for *continuous validation tests* – e.g., a scheduled job might periodically run a known simulation scenario and verify the output against expected results (regression test for the simulation model). Similarly, it might train a model on a known dataset and ensure the performance hasn’t degraded. These scheduled validations (possibly run nightly) help catch any subtle changes in results due to code changes or environment changes.

**Documentation and Transparency:** We will maintain documentation (in the repo and on a wiki) describing how to reproduce results. The PRD (this document) serves as a living high-level reference. In addition, each module will have a README with usage instructions. When publishing findings from this pipeline, we can cite the exact pipeline version and provide links to the repository for transparency.

Finally, the combination of Docker, DVC, and MLflow forms a strong foundation for reproducible workflows. By versioning data and models and automating the environment setup, we satisfy the requirement that anyone (with access to the repository and data) can rerun the analysis and simulation to obtain the same results, fulfilling the scientific rigor needed for validating the GASLIT-AF model.

## Performance Optimization for H100 GPUs

The pipeline is explicitly optimized to exploit the capabilities of NVIDIA H100 GPUs, ensuring that we get maximum throughput and efficiency from the hardware. Below are key performance optimizations and how they are applied:

- **Mixed Precision and Tensor Cores:** H100 GPUs have **4th-generation Tensor Cores** that accelerate matrix operations at mixed precision, including new FP8 support​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/#:~:text=H100%20features%20fourth,to%20massive%2C%20unified%20GPU%20clusters)

   . We will use NVIDIA’s Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) in training deep learning models, allowing computations to use FP16/BF16 where suitable. This can dramatically speed up training of neural networks. For inference, we will consider using FP8 quantization (H100’s Transformer Engine can give up to 4× faster training/inference for large models by using FP8 with minimal accuracy loss​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/#:~:text=H100%20features%20fourth,2)

   ). All our TensorFlow/PyTorch models will be tested with FP16 and even INT8 (via TensorRT calibration) to find the best precision-performance trade-off. For example, the autoencoder and classifier models can likely run in FP16 with negligible accuracy difference, thus doubling throughput on H100.

- **GPU Memory Management:** Each H100 has up to 80GB of HBM2e memory, which we will utilize for large batch processing. We will carefully manage memory by using in-place operations and avoiding unnecessary data copies (especially between host and device). NVIDIA’s memory profiler will be used to identify fragmentation or leaks. If needed, we partition tasks to avoid hitting memory limits – e.g., processing data in chunks. The **Memory Partitioning** aspect also refers to MIG: in cases where tasks don’t need the full GPU, using MIG to split the GPU ensures memory is allocated in isolated blocks for each instance​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/#:~:text=Multi,computing%20resources%20to%20every%20user)

   . This prevents one job from encroaching on another’s memory and provides more deterministic performance. For instance, we might run two Triton model instances on one H100, each in a 40GB MIG slice, serving two different models concurrently with guaranteed memory bandwidth​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/#:~:text=Run%20Simultaneous%20Workloads)

   .

- **Exploiting Sparsity:** H100 Tensor Cores support fine-grained structured sparsity (2:4 sparsity pattern) which can **double effective throughput for supported operations when weights are sparse**​

   [developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-hopper-architecture-in-depth/#:~:text=The%20Sparsity%20feature%20exploits%20fine,of%20standard%20Tensor%20Core)

   ​

   [pny.com](https://www.pny.com/nvidia-h100#:~:text=Discover%20NVIDIA%C2%AE%20H100%20PCIe%20,inference%2C%20it%20can%20also)

   . In our ML models, we will explore pruning techniques to induce sparsity in neural network weights without significantly hurting accuracy. For example, after training a model, we could apply sparsity-aware pruning (keeping 50% of weights zero in each layer as per Ampere/Hopper structured sparsity requirements) and then use TensorRT to deploy this sparse model. This could yield up to ~2× speedup in inference throughput​

   [pny.com](https://www.pny.com/nvidia-h100#:~:text=Discover%20NVIDIA%C2%AE%20H100%20PCIe%20,inference%2C%20it%20can%20also)

   . While sparsity is primarily beneficial for inference, we can also take advantage during training by using sparse matrix libraries if our data or gradients become sparse (e.g. very high-dimensional one-hot genomic features could be exploited).

- **Parallelism and Scalability:** H100 offers NVLink and PCIe Gen5 for fast multi-GPU communication​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/#:~:text=H100%20features%20fourth,to%20massive%2C%20unified%20GPU%20clusters)

   . For parallel tasks (like running many simulations or distributed training of models), we ensure that we use NCCL to efficiently communicate between GPUs. If we run a distributed training job across multiple H100s, we’ll use data parallelism with NCCL AllReduce which is optimized on NVSwitch/NVLink clusters. The cluster networking (InfiniBand NDR) further reduces communication overhead​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/#:~:text=H100%20features%20fourth,to%20massive%2C%20unified%20GPU%20clusters)

   , which is advantageous if we scale to multiple nodes. The pipeline’s design allows horizontal scaling: if more H100 nodes are added, Kubernetes can schedule more parallel jobs (like more simultaneous simulations or more hyperparameter search trials). Our software components will be tested for strong scaling (more GPUs = roughly linear speedup on parallel tasks).

- **HPC and Double Precision:** Many scientific computations (like parts of the simulation engine) may require double precision for numerical stability. H100 dramatically improves FP64 performance – it delivers up to **60 TFLOPS of FP64** (3× more than previous generation) by using FP64 Tensor Cores​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/#:~:text=H100%20triples%20the%20floating,operations%2C%20with%20zero%20code%20changes)

   . Our simulation engine will be compiled to utilize FP64 Tensor Core operations for linear algebra if possible (for instance, using cuBLAS with the Tensor Core math mode for FP64). This means we get supercomputer-level HPC performance on each GPU, accelerating the ODE solvers and linear algebra in bifurcation analysis. H100 also introduced **DPX instructions** for accelerating certain HPC algorithms like dynamic programming (e.g. Smith-Waterman for sequence alignment)​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/#:~:text=H100%20also%20features%20new%20DPX,protein%20alignment%20for%20protein%20structure)

   . If any part of our pipeline involves sequence alignment or similar DP tasks (perhaps in processing genomic sequences), we will benefit from up to 7× speedups there​

   [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/#:~:text=H100%20also%20features%20new%20DPX,protein%20alignment%20for%20protein%20structure)

   .

- **Triton Model Optimization:** When serving models on H100, we will use Triton’s features to maximize throughput. This includes **dynamic batching** (aggregating inference requests to increase batch size and keep tensor cores busy) and launching multiple model instances. We will profile inference to find the optimal number of model instances per GPU; often, two instances can increase throughput by overlapping computation and data transfer​

   [docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/archives/tensorrt_inference_server_190/tensorrt-inference-server-guide/docs/optimization.html#:~:text=In%20this%20case%20having%20two,second%20compared%20with%20one%20instance)

   . We will also ensure to use the TensorRT optimized engine for each model on H100 – the TensorRT engine will use H100’s FP8 and sparsity where applicable. As noted earlier, enabling TensorRT optimizations yielded **2× throughput and 50% lower latency** in NVIDIA’s benchmarks​

   [docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/archives/tensorrt_inference_server_190/tensorrt-inference-server-guide/docs/optimization.html#:~:text=The%20TensorRT%20optimization%20provided%202x,can%20provide%20significant%20performance%20improvement)

   , so we expect similar gains for our models.

- **Concurrency and Pipeline Parallelism:** Our pipeline is structured to run many components concurrently (e.g. data preprocessing on one GPU while training on another, or running multiple simulations in parallel). The H100’s ability to partition into MIG or simply schedule multiple streams means we can fully pack the GPU with work. For example, we could run an inference stream and a training stream on one GPU if they together don’t saturate it. Using CUDA streams and ensuring computations are asynchronous will help overlap computations with data transfers.
- **Performance Profiling and Tuning:** We will regularly profile the pipeline using tools like Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute to identify bottlenecks. If certain kernels are not utilizing GPU well, we may refactor or use custom CUDA kernels. The flexibility of our design (Python with underlying CUDA libs) means if needed, we can write a custom CUDA C++ extension for a critical loop (for instance, a custom kernel for a specific analysis in the simulation). We will also monitor GPU utilization metric: our goal is to keep the GPUs busy near 90-100% during heavy workloads. If utilization is low, that signals an I/O bottleneck or single-threaded section which we will address (perhaps by moving more computation to GPU or multi-threading CPU prep work).
- **Memory bandwidth and cache:** The H100 has very high memory bandwidth. We’ll aim to use algorithms that are bandwidth-bound when possible (since H100 excels there), and reuse data in on-GPU memory to leverage caches. For example, in the simulation, if we can keep a lot of state in shared memory or L2 cache by appropriate blocking, we will. Also, when running multiple model instances, each MIG partition or each stream will effectively use distinct portions of L2, reducing thrashing.

In summary, by exploiting **H100’s Tensor Cores (for FP16/FP8), large memory, NVLink scalability, and new instructions for HPC**, the pipeline will achieve high performance. These optimizations ensure that even as the complexity of the GASLIT-AF model or the volume of multi-omics data grows, the pipeline remains capable of delivering results in a timely manner, making interactive analysis feasible and scaling to heavy validation workloads.

**Explanation of Structure:**

- The `simulation` package encapsulates everything related to the GASLIT-AF dynamical model. This separation allows domain experts to focus on the simulation code (which might be in Python and/or C++ with CUDA extensions). The `analysis` submodule there includes the advanced analysis (bifurcation and chaos tools) which operate on simulation outputs. If we add a compiled component (C++/CUDA), we might have it in a subfolder here with CMake or setup scripts to build it.
- The `ml` package handles multi-omics data processing and modeling. By subdividing into `data_preprocessing`, `models`, `training`, and `causal`, we make it clear where each kind of functionality lives. For example, imputation functions live in `data_preprocessing/impute.py`, autoencoder architecture in `models/autoencoder.py`, training logic (which might use PyTorch Lightning or custom loops) in `training/train_autoencoder.py`, and causal discovery algorithms (maybe wrapping a library or custom code) in `causal/pc_algorithm.py`.
- The `api` directory contains the web service code. We separate route definitions for clarity (e.g. a `simulation_routes.py` for all simulation-related endpoints, `ml_routes.py` for prediction endpoints). If Triton is used, the `triton/` subdir will serve as the model repository (with model configs and possibly a `models/` directory inside it where we place model files for Triton to load). We will include a `Dockerfile` in this folder to containerize the API server (if not using Triton’s own image).
- The `notebooks` folder will be part of the repo with static examples. These are source of truth for typical usage and can be tested (there are tools to run notebooks in CI to ensure they execute without error). They also help onboard users to the pipeline.
- The `configs` directory holds YAML configuration that can be loaded by the application at runtime. This way, changing a hyperparameter or a file path doesn’t require code changes. For instance, `simulation_config.yaml` might define default integration step sizes, or which parameters to sweep in a bifurcation analysis. We can use a library like Hydra or argparse to load these configs and override values via CLI or environment when needed.
- The `orchestration` directory is about deployment and operations. `k8s/` could contain a Helm chart with templates for our deployments and services, making it easy to install the pipeline in a cluster. Each container likely has its own Dockerfile (we may keep them in `docker/` or at the root of each component directory). CI/CD config might include YAML files for GitHub Actions pipelines (e.g. test, build, deploy jobs). Also, any infrastructure-as-code or scripts (like to initialize a database or seed some data) can reside here. This directory documents how to get the whole system up and running in an environment.
- `tests` provides automated tests. We aim for good coverage: e.g., test that the ODE solver returns correct results on a known simple ODE, test that the imputer fills in known missing values correctly, test API endpoints with dummy dependencies (perhaps using FastAPI’s test client).
- `data` directory is mostly symbolic here; we won’t store large data in Git, but we might store small example data for tests. DVC will manage actual dataset storage (possibly linking to remote storage for large files).
- The root also contains standard files like README with instructions, and a `requirements.txt` for installing the Python environment. (If using conda, an `environment.yml` can list packages including specific CUDA tooling versions).

This structure separates concerns: simulation vs ML vs API are decoupled, which also means different team members (or contributors) can work in parallel. It also makes it easier to package components if needed (we could package `simulation` and `ml` as Python libraries).

As development proceeds, we will adjust the structure as necessary, but the above layout provides a solid starting point that aligns with the functional components outlined in this PRD. It ensures clarity, maintainability, and extensibility for the GASLIT-AF validation pipeline codebase.
