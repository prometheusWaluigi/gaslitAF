# Implementing the GASLIT-AF Model: A Practical Guide for Clinicians

This document outlines a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to managing complex chronic illnesses, particularly those fitting the GASLIT-AF (Genetic Autonomic Structural Linked Instability Theorem - Allodynic Fatigue) model. This model views conditions like ME/CFS, Long COVID, POTS, hEDS, Fibromyalgia, and MCAS as interconnected manifestations of a shared underlying dysregulation.

## 1. Diagnostics: A Comprehensive Evaluation

The first step is a thorough diagnostic workup to identify the specific issues a patient is experiencing.

### 1.1. Targeted Lab Tests

These tests help pinpoint mast cell activation, neuroinflammation, and metabolic problems.

*   **Mast Cell Activation:**
    *   Serum tryptase
    *   Plasma histamine
    *   Prostaglandin D₂
    *   24-hour urinary N-methylhistamine
*   **Hyperadrenergic POTS:**
    *   Plasma norepinephrine (supine vs. standing) - Elevated standing norepinephrine indicates a hyperadrenergic state.
*   **Neuroinflammation:**
    *   Inflammatory cytokine panel (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, TGF-β) - Look for signs of chronic immune activation.
*   **Methylation Issues:**
    *   Homocysteine
    *   Folate/B₁₂ levels - Assess for MTHFR or other polymorphisms that can impair folate metabolism.
*   **Mitochondrial Function:**
    *   Serum lactate
    *   Carnitine levels
    *   CoQ10 level - Detect deficits in cellular energy metabolism.
*   **Standard Lab Work:**
    *   CBC (Complete Blood Count)
    *   Metabolic panel
    *   TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone)
    *   Cortisol - Rule out common causes of fatigue.

### 1.2. Autonomic Function Testing

This is crucial for diagnosing POTS and other autonomic nervous system problems.

*   **Head-Up Tilt Table Test (HUT):**
    *   Measure heart rate and blood pressure at intervals.
    *   A rise in HR ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes upright (without hypotension) supports a POTS diagnosis.
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis:**
    *   Quantify autonomic imbalance.
    *   Reduced HRV (low high-frequency power, high LF/HF ratio) suggests increased sympathetic activity and reduced vagal tone.
*   **Autonomic Reflex Screening:**
    *   Deep breathing
    *   Valsalva maneuver
    *   QSART sweat test - Identify small-fiber neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy.
*   **Small-Fiber Neuropathy:**
    *   Skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density
    *   Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing - Consider if suspected (common in fibromyalgia/ME/CFS).

### 1.3. Imaging and Functional Studies

These tests help identify structural or perfusion issues.

*   **Brain MRI:** Rule out structural lesions (e.g., Chiari malformation, multiple sclerosis).
*   **Cranio-Cervical MRI (with flexion/extension):** Evaluate craniocervical instability or cervical stenosis.
*   **Brain Perfusion Imaging (Doppler, SPECT):** Assess cerebral blood flow, especially upon upright posture.
*   **Sleep Study (Polysomnography):** Identify sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea, restless legs, narcolepsy).
* **Tethered Cord or Spinal Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow:** Upright MRI if symptoms suggest occult tethered cord or intracranial hypertension.

### 1.4. Genomic and Epigenetic Analysis

These tests provide insights into genetic predispositions.

*   **Polygenic Risk Profile:**
    *   MTHFR C677T or other methylation-related polymorphisms
    *   Variants in adrenergic receptor genes
*   **Targeted Genetic Testing:**
    *   Rule out monogenic conditions that mimic the phenotype (e.g., COL3A1 for vascular EDS, FBN1/TGFBR1 for Marfan/Loeys-Dietz).
    *   Confirm Ehlers-Danlos subtype.
*   **Epigenetic/Gene Expression Panels:**
    *   Identify patterns of immune or mitochondrial gene activation.
    *   NK cell function test or gene expression signature (for ME/CFS).
* **Consultation:** Consider a consultation with an integrative genomics specialist or genetic counselor.

## 2. Pharmacologic and Supplement Interventions
