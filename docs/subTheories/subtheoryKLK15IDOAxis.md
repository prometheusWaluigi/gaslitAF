# GASLIT-AF Subtheory: KLK15–IDO Axis as a Recursive Collapse Engine

## Abstract
The KLK15–IDO axis represents a dual-recursive mechanism by which structural instability and immune-metabolic dysregulation converge to drive the pathological attractor state seen in chronic multi-system syndromes (CMSSs) such as ME/CFS, Long COVID, POTS, hEDS, fibromyalgia, and MCAS. This subtheory of GASLIT-AF frames KLK15-mediated extracellular matrix degradation and IDO-driven tryptophan hijacking as coupled dynamical loops that recursively reinforce collapse. We propose that this axis forms a biochemical “kill-switch” encoding both the fragility and irreversibility of the chronic illness state.

## 1. KLK15 and ECM Instability
**KLK15**, a kallikrein serine protease, regulates extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Variants in KLK15 may lead to hyperactive ECM degradation, particularly in fascia-rich interfaces, resulting in:
- Microinjuries in connective tissue
- Abnormal mechanotransduction
- Increased mast cell activation via DAMP signaling
- TNFα and IL-6 elevation in the local milieu

These processes create a recursive ECM-inflammation loop:
> KLK15 variant → fascia microdamage → mast cell response → cytokine surge → further ECM degradation.

This elevates system noise (σ) and lowers proprioceptive coherence (C), destabilizing autonomic feedback (Ψ_ECM ↔ Ψ_ANS).

## 2. IDO-Kynurenine Pathway as Immune-Metabolic Brake
**IDO1/IDO2**, activated by TNFα and IFNγ, catabolize tryptophan into kynurenine derivatives. Chronic upregulation leads to:
- Quinolinic acid accumulation → NMDA receptor overactivation → excitotoxicity
- 5-HT depletion → mood, pain, and circadian collapse
- NAD+ depletion → mitochondrial suppression
- T cell exhaustion → immune tolerance

This initiates a recursive tryptophan-depletion loop:
> Inflammation → IDO activation → kynurenine load → neurotoxicity + 5-HT/NAD+ loss → more stress → more inflammation.

The loop has long recursive delay (Θ), unfolding over days to weeks, but locks in via limbic destabilization.

## 3. Dual-Loop Coupling: Recursive Fascia-Metabolite Feedback
The intersection point is **mast cell–cytokine–IDO cross-activation**, modulated by KLK15-induced ECM stress. The loops co-activate:
- KLK15-driven ECM damage → TNFα/IL-6 → IDO upregulation
- IDO-driven NAD+ loss → impaired ECM maintenance + energy collapse

### Biochemical Bifurcation Conditions:
- High γ: KLK15 + IDO polymorphisms
- High Λ: Accumulated mechanical and immunological stress
- Low Ω: ECS dysfunction, serotonin depletion, redox exhaustion
- High σ: ECM proprioceptive noise + tryptophan flux volatility

Once Ψ crosses Ξ (collapse index), the state flips into the GASLIT-AF attractor:
> Fascia breaks → brain fog rises → fatigue entrenches → illness loops persist.

## 4. Phenotypic Mapping
| System | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| ECM    | Joint laxity, POTS, fascial pain |
| Immune | MCAS, cytokine storm tendencies |
| Metabolic | NAD+ drain, low ATP, PEM |
| Neural | Limbic dysregulation, sensory gating collapse |
| Psychiatric | Depression, anxiety, insomnia |

## 5. Therapeutic Implications
**Targeting Both Loops Simultaneously**
- *IDO Pathway*: 1-MT (Indoximod), tryptophan, kynurenine traps, AHR antagonists
- *KLK15 Axis*: Bradykinin receptor antagonists, protease inhibitors, ECM support (Vitamin C, hydroxyproline)
- *Buffers*: NAD+ (NR/NMN), 5-HTP, tVNS, ECS enhancers
- *Mechanical Stabilization*: Fascia-oriented PT, prolotherapy, myofascial release

## 6. Dynamical Embedding in GASLIT-AF
The KLK15–IDO axis is a **recursive node-coupling** between:
- Ψ_ECM → Ψ_Cyt → Ψ_Metab → Ψ_Neuro
- Feedback weights modulated by γ and Λ
- Recursive delay (Θ) and noise amplification (σ) define attractor depth

Collapse is marked by bifurcation in state vector Ψ(t):
- Loss of coherence C
- Exceeding entropy production σ
- Breach of resilience envelope defined by Ω

## Conclusion
The KLK15–IDO coupling represents a biochemical attractor engine—two recursive, phase-delayed, self-amplifying loops that encode the invisible collapse pathway of GASLIT-AF. By formalizing this subsystem, we illuminate a precise point of intervention in otherwise opaque chronic multi-system syndromes. KLK15 and IDO are not epiphenomena—they are gatekeepers of collapse.
