# The KLK15–IDO Axis in Chronic Multi-System Syndromes (CMSS)

## Overview of KLK15 and IDO in CMSS  
Chronic multi-system syndromes (CMSS) such as ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), Long COVID (Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection), POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), hypermobile EDS (hEDS), fibromyalgia, and MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome) often coexist or share overlapping features. Emerging evidence implicates two biochemical players in these conditions: **Kallikrein-15 (KLK15)** and the **indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO1 and IDO2)**. KLK15 is a serine protease in the kallikrein-kinin system, which influences connective tissue integrity and inflammatory mediators, while IDO1/IDO2 are enzymes that regulate tryptophan metabolism and immune tolerance. Recent studies suggest alterations in KLK15 and IDO pathways may contribute to the connective tissue fragility, dysautonomia, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances seen across CMSS. Below we examine evidence for changes in KLK15 and IDO expression, genetic variants, and mechanistic links in these syndromes.

## Altered Expression of KLK15 and IDO in CMSS

**KLK15 Expression and Activity:** KLK15 is normally expressed in various glandular and connective tissues (e.g. tendon, skin) ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=identified%20only%20one%20of%20these,DANN%20scores%20of%2024%20and)). In hypermobile EDS, which involves joint hypermobility and tissue fragility, KLK15’s activity may be aberrant due to genetic mutation (discussed later). While direct protein level measurements in patients are limited, functional studies provide clues: a pathogenic KLK15 variant (Gly226Asp) introduced in mice led to *structural changes in connective tissue*, including significantly more elastic tendons and ~20% thinner collagen fibrils compared to normal ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=higher%20strain%2C%20and%20lower%20toe,As%20these%20mechanical%20changes%20are)). These findings imply that altered KLK15 function can weaken extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity. Consistently, plasma proteomics in ME/CFS (which often has joint and muscle pain overlaps with fibromyalgia) showed elevated **kininogen-1 (KNG1)** – a substrate of kallikreins – suggesting heightened kallikrein-kinin system activity ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373296/#:~:text=IGLC7%2C%20KNG1%2C%20and%20PON3,pain%20in%20women%20with%20chronic)). KNG1’s cleavage product, **bradykinin**, is an inflammatory mediator causing vasodilation, vascular permeability, pain, and nitric oxide release ([

Thus, even if KLK15 protein levels are not directly measured, *upstream and downstream markers* (like kininogen/bradykinin) indicate the kallikrein pathway is more active in at least a subset of CMSS patients (e.g. ME/CFS without IBS comorbidity showed higher KNG1 ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373296/#:~:text=IGLC7%2C%20KNG1%2C%20and%20PON3,pain%20in%20women%20with%20chronic))). In summary, CMSS patients may experience **increased KLK15 pathway activity**, leading to excessive bradykinin generation and ECM remodeling, which can manifest as connective tissue laxity (as in hEDS) and inflammatory symptoms.

**IDO1/IDO2 Expression and Activity:** Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 and 2 are enzymes that catabolize tryptophan into kynurenine, modulating immune responses. In healthy conditions, **IDO1** is usually low but strongly induced by inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interferon-γ), whereas **IDO2** is only weakly expressed in most tissues ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=IDO2,lymphocytes%20%5B51%2C78%2C79)) ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=expression%20in%20immune%20cells%20is,constitutive%20in%20circulating%20myeloid%20DCs)). Strikingly, in *Long COVID* patients, studies have found abnormally sustained expression of IDO2 in immune cells and tissues **months after** the acute infection. For example, one 2023 study reported that **IDO2 is highly expressed and enzymatically active in PBMCs of Long COVID (PASC) patients**, as well as in their brain tissue, long after the virus has cleared ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=IDO2%20is%20expressed%20and%20active,IDO2%20expression%20and%20activity)). This persistent IDO2 upregulation was accompanied by cellular metabolic disturbances (e.g. enhanced autophagy, reduced mitochondrial function) ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=IDO2%20is%20expressed%20and%20active,IDO2%20expression%20and%20activity)) ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=IDO2%20is%20expressed%20in%20blood,2)). Notably, the aberrant IDO2 activity in these patients could be normalized *in vitro* by blocking the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which drives IDO2 expression ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=IDO2%20is%20expressed%20and%20active,IDO2%20expression%20and%20activity)) ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=SARS,induced%20symptoms%20and%20pathology)). In acute COVID-19, by contrast, IDO1 tends to be the dominant isozyme induced (especially in milder cases), whereas severe/fatal cases showed a shift toward IDO2 predominance ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=expressed%20in%20the%20pulmonary%20blood,tone%20of%20pulmonary%20vessels%2C%20and)) ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=whereas%20IDO2%20is%20predominant%20in,is%20discussed%20in%20light%20of)). This imbalance led researchers to hypothesize that **IDO1 is protective (helps regulate vascular tone and immunity), while excessive IDO2 in severe COVID and PASC contributes to pathology** ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=expressed%20in%20the%20pulmonary%20blood,tone%20of%20pulmonary%20vessels%2C%20and)) ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=match%20at%20L779%20Although%20IDO1,to%20the%20functions%20associated%20with)). 

In ME/CFS, direct measures of IDO activity have yielded mixed results, but subgroups can be identified. A metabolomic study in 2021 found *no overall difference* in serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (a proxy for total IDO/TDO activity) between ME/CFS patients and controls; however, patients whose illness began with an infection had a significantly **higher** kynurenine/tryptophan ratio than those with non-infectious onset (44.1 vs 33.2 ×10^3, *p* = 0.015) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8615774/#:~:text=kynurenine%2Ftryptophan%20ratio%20%28p%20%3D%200,Table%205)) ([

This suggests post-infectious ME/CFS patients maintain an activated tryptophan catabolism (possibly via IDO1) long-term. Other studies have observed elevated levels of downstream kynurenine metabolites in ME/CFS, such as a higher 3-hydroxykynurenine/kynurenine ratio (indicative of increased Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase activity) and higher kynurenic acid levels ([

Although IDO mRNA was not explicitly reported in those datasets, the presence of an IFN-β/IFN-α–driven program implies IDO1 could be upregulated in fibromyalgia immune cells as well. Taken together, these findings across Long COVID, ME/CFS, and fibromyalgia indicate **chronic activation or imbalance of the IDO pathway** (with IDO1 and IDO2 being differentially involved depending on context). This dysregulation can affect neuro-immune function – for instance, prolonged IDO activity depletes tryptophan (affecting serotonin production and protein synthesis) while accumulating kynurenine metabolites that can impair neuronal function or promote oxidative stress ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=match%20at%20L742%20IDO1%20has,kynurenine%2C%20kynurenic%20acid)) ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=match%20at%20L779%20Although%20IDO1,to%20the%20functions%20associated%20with)).

## Genetic Variants in KLK15 and IDO Associated with Susceptibility

A growing body of genetic research suggests that **heritable variants in KLK15 and IDO genes may predispose individuals to CMSS** or modify disease severity. Key findings from recent studies are summarized in **Table 1**.

- **KLK15 mutations in hEDS (± POTS/MCAS):** Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), Norris Lab researchers discovered a rare missense mutation in *Kallikrein-15 (KLK15)* that segregates with hypermobile EDS in multiple families ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=cohort%20of%20sporadic%20hEDS%20patients,diagnosis%20and%20better%20clinical%20outcomes)). This variant (chr19:50825890 C>T, encoding p.Gly226Asp in KLK15) was the only mutation perfectly tracking the hEDS phenotype in a large four-generation pedigree ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=sequencing%20,DANN%20scores%20of%2024%20and)). It is exceedingly rare in the general population (minor allele frequency ~0.2% ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=Kallikrein%20serine,DANN%20scores%20of%2024%20and))) and is predicted deleterious to protein function (CADD score 24) ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=Kallikrein%20serine,DANN%20scores%20of%2024%20and)). Notably, when this **KLK15^G226D** variant was knocked into mice, the animals developed *connective tissue defects across multiple organ systems*, mirroring human hEDS features ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=cohort%20of%20sporadic%20hEDS%20patients,diagnosis%20and%20better%20clinical%20outcomes)). Clinically, many hEDS patients with this mutation also report dysautonomia and allergic/inflammatory issues – indeed, EDS often co-occurs with POTS and MCAS (sometimes termed a “trifecta” of conditions) ([One Gene Mutation Links Three Mysterious, Debilitating Diseases - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/one-gene-mutation-links-three-mysterious-debilitating-diseases/#:~:text=I%20have%20Ehlers,that%20links%20all%20three%20conditions)) ([One Gene Mutation Links Three Mysterious, Debilitating Diseases - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/one-gene-mutation-links-three-mysterious-debilitating-diseases/#:~:text=,that%20links%20all%20three%20conditions)). This has led to speculation that the KLK15 variant could be a unifying cause in such patients. In support of a broader role, a burden test in **197 unrelated hEDS patients** found a significant enrichment of rare variants across the *entire KLK gene family* (15 kallikrein genes on 19q13) ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=WES%20was%20performed%20on%20197,thus)). Fully 11 of 15 KLK genes had more rare damaging variants in hEDS cases than expected (p<0.05 each), and the gene-cluster-wide significance was *p* = 2.28×10^−14 ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=WES%20was%20performed%20on%20197,thus)). This remarkable result suggests that **genetic defects in kallikreins (KLK15 foremost among them) are important inherited risk factors for hEDS** and possibly its common comorbidities. Aside from KLK15, another genetic link between EDS, POTS, and MCAS was reported in 2016: a subset of patients were found to carry extra copies of the tryptase gene (*TPSAB1*), causing high basal tryptase (alpha-tryptasemia) and an EDS/POTS/MCAS phenotype ([One Gene Mutation Links Three Mysterious, Debilitating Diseases - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/one-gene-mutation-links-three-mysterious-debilitating-diseases/#:~:text=I%20have%20Ehlers,that%20links%20all%20three%20conditions)) ([One Gene Mutation Links Three Mysterious, Debilitating Diseases - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/one-gene-mutation-links-three-mysterious-debilitating-diseases/#:~:text=,that%20links%20all%20three%20conditions)). Together, these findings underline that *connective tissue and mast-cell related genes* can underlie the clustering of CMSS. KLK15, in particular, is emerging as a plausible **hEDS-POTS-MCAS susceptibility gene**.

- **IDO2 variants in ME/CFS (± Long COVID):** Unlike KLK15, which is a rare variant scenario, the IDO pathway risk appears to come from **common polymorphisms**. An ambitious genetic screen of the **Severely Ill ME/CFS Big Data Study** (an NIH-funded multi-omics cohort) highlighted *IDO2* as a top candidate gene ([The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS by Robert D. Phair, PhD and Ron Davis, PhD, Stanford Collaboration - Open Medicine Foundation Canada](https://www.omfcanada.ngo/the-ido-metabolic-trap/#:~:text=genetic%20mutations%20that%20were%20common,at%20least%20one%20of%20them)). Investigators searched databases for genetic variants that are common in the general population yet predicted to damage enzyme function, reasoning that ME/CFS outbreaks imply a common predisposition allele ([The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS by Robert D. Phair, PhD and Ron Davis, PhD, Stanford Collaboration - Open Medicine Foundation Canada](https://www.omfcanada.ngo/the-ido-metabolic-trap/#:~:text=Like%20most%20chronic%20diseases%2C%20ME%2FCFS,every%20ME%2FCFS%20patient%20in%20the)). IDO2 stood out because it harbors **four frequent loss-of-function variants**; remarkably, *every* ME/CFS patient in the severe cohort had at least one of these IDO2 variants ([The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS by Robert D. Phair, PhD and Ron Davis, PhD, Stanford Collaboration - Open Medicine Foundation Canada](https://www.omfcanada.ngo/the-ido-metabolic-trap/#:~:text=genetic%20mutations%20that%20were%20common,at%20least%20one%20of%20them)). Two of the best-characterized IDO2 SNPs are **R248W** (rs10109853) and **Y359X** (rs4503083). R248W (Arg248Trp) occurs in ~25–30% of alleles and causes a >90% reduction in IDO2 enzymatic activity ([Current Challenges for IDO2 as Target in Cancer Immunotherapy](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.679953/full#:~:text=Current%20Challenges%20for%20IDO2%20as,Y359X%29)). Y359X (Tyr359*) is a stop-gain mutation that truncates the enzyme; around 8–10% of individuals carry at least one copy ([Current Challenges for IDO2 as Target in Cancer Immunotherapy](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.679953/full#:~:text=Current%20Challenges%20for%20IDO2%20as,Y359X%29)). In ME/CFS patients, the combined presence of these *non-functional IDO2 alleles* is significantly higher than in healthy controls ([The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS by Robert D. Phair, PhD and Ron Davis, PhD, Stanford Collaboration - Open Medicine Foundation Canada](https://www.omfcanada.ngo/the-ido-metabolic-trap/#:~:text=genetic%20mutations%20that%20were%20common,at%20least%20one%20of%20them)), suggesting a genetic reliance on the IDO1 isozyme for tryptophan metabolism. Table 1 shows that other IDO2 variants (e.g. IDO2  *353ins* and *Ala189Thr*, not shown) also contribute to this genetic burden (Phair *et al.*, 2019). The implication is that **many ME/CFS patients are genetically predisposed to have limited IDO2 function**, which can set the stage for a metabolic trap: if a triggering event (infection, stress, etc.) drives up cellular tryptophan levels, IDO1 alone may be unable to compensate, leading to an accumulation of tryptophan and downstream “locking” of metabolism in an abnormal state ([The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS by Robert D. Phair, PhD and Ron Davis, PhD, Stanford Collaboration - Open Medicine Foundation Canada](https://www.omfcanada.ngo/the-ido-metabolic-trap/#:~:text=This%20story%20isn%E2%80%99t%20solely%20about,then%20IDO1%20will%20stop%20making)) ([The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS by Robert D. Phair, PhD and Ron Davis, PhD, Stanford Collaboration - Open Medicine Foundation Canada](https://www.omfcanada.ngo/the-ido-metabolic-trap/#:~:text=tryptophan%20is%20at%20high%20levels,is%20the%20IDO%20metabolic%20trap)). This **“IDO metabolic trap” hypothesis** proposes that high intracellular tryptophan, coupled with absent IDO2 activity, causes IDO1 to paradoxically shut off (due to substrate inhibition), thereby *sustaining* the high-tryptophan, low-kynurenine state ([The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS by Robert D. Phair, PhD and Ron Davis, PhD, Stanford Collaboration - Open Medicine Foundation Canada](https://www.omfcanada.ngo/the-ido-metabolic-trap/#:~:text=tryptophan%20is%20at%20high%20levels,is%20the%20IDO%20metabolic%20trap)). The result is a chronic neuro-immune-metabolic dysfunction consistent with ME/CFS symptoms. It is intriguing that *Long COVID* shares many symptomatology and may share this genetic risk: researchers have noted that about 30% of the general population have an IDO2-inactivating genotype ([Current Challenges for IDO2 as Target in Cancer Immunotherapy](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.679953/full#:~:text=Current%20Challenges%20for%20IDO2%20as,Y359X%29)), which could partly explain why only a subset of people develop lingering fatigue and dysautonomia after COVID-19. While large-scale Long COVID genetic studies are still ongoing, it is plausible that **the same IDO2 variants (R248W, Y359X, etc.) contribute to post-viral syndromes** like Long COVID and ME/CFS. No pathogenic mutations in the IDO1 gene have been firmly linked to these syndromes to date (IDO1 is highly conserved, given its vital immune role), but research is examining whether certain **HLA alleles or regulatory variants** might interact with the IDO2 genetic background to modulate disease risk.

## Mechanistic Links Between KLK15 and IDO Pathways in CMSS

**KLK15, Extracellular Matrix & Immune Activation:** KLK15 sits at the intersection of connective tissue biology and inflammatory signaling. As a protease, KLK15 can degrade components of the extracellular matrix or activate other proteases in cascading fashion. The discovery that a KLK15 mutation causes thinner collagen fibrils and more elastic ligaments ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=higher%20strain%2C%20and%20lower%20toe,As%20these%20mechanical%20changes%20are)) provides a direct link to the tissue fragility in hEDS. But kallikreins also have potent immune effects: KLK15 (and related kallikreins) cleave kininogens to release **bradykinin**, a peptide that not only causes blood vessels to dilate and leak (contributing to orthostatic intolerance and edema) but also directly triggers pain and inflammation ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373296/#:~:text=IGLC7%2C%20KNG1%2C%20and%20PON3,pain%20in%20women%20with%20chronic)). High bradykinin levels can produce symptoms like those in fibromyalgia (widespread pain, tenderness) and in POTS (low blood pressure, reflex tachycardia due to vasodilation). Importantly, **bradykinin can induce mast cell degranulation**, prompting the release of histamine, tryptase, cytokines, and other mediators ([Mast cells, heparin and bradykinin: The effects of mast cells on the kinin-kallikrein system - Mast Attack](https://www.mastattack.org/2014/11/mast-cells-heparin-bradykinin-effects-mast-cells-kinin-kallikrein-system/#:~:text=Overproduction%20of%20bradykinin%20is%20one,and%20serotonin%2C%20among%20other%20contents)). This creates a positive feedback loop between the kallikrein-kinin system and mast cells: mast cell activation (as occurs in MCAS) can in turn amplify bradykinin production by providing heparin and other co-factors for kallikrein activation ([Mast cells, heparin and bradykinin: The effects of mast cells on the kinin-kallikrein system - Mast Attack](https://www.mastattack.org/2014/11/mast-cells-heparin-bradykinin-effects-mast-cells-kinin-kallikrein-system/#:~:text=surface,too%20much%20bradykinin%20is%20formed)) ([Mast cells, heparin and bradykinin: The effects of mast cells on the kinin-kallikrein system - Mast Attack](https://www.mastattack.org/2014/11/mast-cells-heparin-bradykinin-effects-mast-cells-kinin-kallikrein-system/#:~:text=Overproduction%20of%20bradykinin%20is%20one,and%20serotonin%2C%20among%20other%20contents)). Thus, a KLK15 dysfunction could set off a chain reaction: weakened connective tissue (leading to joint hypermobility and microinjuries) → excessive bradykinin release (due to abnormal kallikrein activity) → mast cell activation (causing allergic-type and inflammatory symptoms) → further kallikrein activation, and so on ([Mast cells, heparin and bradykinin: The effects of mast cells on the kinin-kallikrein system - Mast Attack](https://www.mastattack.org/2014/11/mast-cells-heparin-bradykinin-effects-mast-cells-kinin-kallikrein-system/#:~:text=Overproduction%20of%20bradykinin%20is%20one,and%20serotonin%2C%20among%20other%20contents)). This model aligns with the observed clustering of hEDS, POTS, and MCAS in patients ([One Gene Mutation Links Three Mysterious, Debilitating Diseases - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/one-gene-mutation-links-three-mysterious-debilitating-diseases/#:~:text=I%20have%20Ehlers,that%20links%20all%20three%20conditions)). In summary, **KLK15-driven bradykinin surges may compromise both the structural integrity of connective tissues and provoke chronic immune activation**. Clinically, this could explain the combination of musculoskeletal issues, autonomic dysfunction, and mast cell-mediated symptoms in CMSS.

**IDO Pathway, Neuro-Immune-Metabolic Dysregulation:** The IDO1/IDO2 pathway provides immune homeostasis by regulating tryptophan levels – depriving pathogens and modulating T-cell responses. When this pathway is dysregulated, multiple systems suffer. In inflammatory conditions, high IDO1 activity shunts tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which can lead to accumulation of neuroactive metabolites: for example, kynurenine and quinolinic acid (a downstream product) can cause neurotoxicity at high levels, contributing to “brain fog,” depression, or neuroinflammation often reported in ME/CFS and Long COVID. Conversely, if IDO activity is pathologically low (as posited in the IDO metabolic trap), excess tryptophan might fuel serotonin or microbial pathways in an unbalanced way, or lead to persistent immune activation because one of the key negative feedback mechanisms (T-cell suppression via tryptophan depletion) is lost ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=match%20at%20L779%20Although%20IDO1,to%20the%20functions%20associated%20with)) ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=Although%20IDO1%20is%20genetically%20homologous,to%20the%20functions%20associated%20with)). Indeed, IDO1 is known to **suppress effector T-cells and promote regulatory T-cells** by starving T-cells of tryptophan and generating immunosuppressive metabolites like kynurenine ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=match%20at%20L742%20IDO1%20has,kynurenine%2C%20kynurenic%20acid)). If IDO1 function is inadequate (due to IDO2 mutations locking it in an off-state), the immune system may tilt toward a more pro-inflammatory, auto-reactive state. This could manifest as the low-grade inflammation, elevated Th17/interferon signatures, and autoantibody findings reported in subsets of ME/CFS and fibromyalgia ([

On the other hand, **excessive IDO activity** (especially IDO2-driven) might contribute to pathologic fatigue by depleting nutrients and inducing a catabolic state. The long-term IDO2 expression seen in Long COVID patients was linked to impaired cellular energetics (mitochondrial dysfunction) and hyperautophagy ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=IDO2%20is%20expressed%20and%20active,IDO2%20expression%20and%20activity)) ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=IDO2%20is%20expressed%20in%20blood,2)), which mirrors the energy production issues hypothesized in ME/CFS. Moreover, IDO2 may have distinct immune effects: unlike IDO1, research suggests IDO2 can promote *autoimmune B-cell activation* and inflammation ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=match%20at%20L779%20Although%20IDO1,to%20the%20functions%20associated%20with)) ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=Although%20IDO1%20is%20genetically%20homologous,to%20the%20functions%20associated%20with)). Thus, chronic IDO2 upregulation (as in Long COVID) might sustain autoantibody production or inflammatory cytokine release, contributing to symptoms like orthostatic intolerance (through endothelial inflammation) and cognitive impairment. Notably, one study of post-COVID endothelial dysfunction found an “unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 expression” in lung vessels – with IDO1 reduced and IDO2 increased – which could lead to **dysregulated vascular tone and peripheral perfusion** issues ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=expressed%20in%20the%20pulmonary%20blood,tone%20of%20pulmonary%20vessels%2C%20and)) ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=whereas%20IDO2%20is%20predominant%20in,is%20discussed%20in%20light%20of)). This might help explain POTS-like symptoms (tachycardia, dizziness) in Long COVID, as proper IDO1 function appears necessary for vascular health ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=expressed%20in%20the%20pulmonary%20blood,tone%20of%20pulmonary%20vessels%2C%20and)).

**Interplay of KLK15 and IDO Axes:** While KLK15 and IDO work in distinct biochemical pathways, in CMSS they may intersect functionally. Chronic inflammation and tissue stress are common denominators: a KLK15 mutation can cause recurrent tissue injury (e.g. micro-tears in hypermobile joints), which provokes inflammation and cytokine release; those cytokines (IL-1, IFNs, TNF-α) could induce IDO1 in immune cells ([Unbalanced IDO1/IDO2 Endothelial Expression and Skewed Keynurenine Pathway in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Pneumonia](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1332#:~:text=match%20at%20L735%20neurodegenerative%20disorders%2C,are%20also%20provided%20by%20Trp)), altering tryptophan metabolism. Conversely, an IDO2-related metabolic trap could fail to resolve inflammation, leading to continuous mast cell activation and possibly upregulation of kallikreins (since mast cell tryptase and kallikrein pathways can mutually enhance each other ([Mast cells, heparin and bradykinin: The effects of mast cells on the kinin-kallikrein system - Mast Attack](https://www.mastattack.org/2014/11/mast-cells-heparin-bradykinin-effects-mast-cells-kinin-kallikrein-system/#:~:text=So%20how%20are%20mast%20cells,the%20exclusive%20producers%20of%20heparin)) ([Mast cells, heparin and bradykinin: The effects of mast cells on the kinin-kallikrein system - Mast Attack](https://www.mastattack.org/2014/11/mast-cells-heparin-bradykinin-effects-mast-cells-kinin-kallikrein-system/#:~:text=of%20clot%20formation,too%20much%20bradykinin%20is%20formed))). A hypothetical example: suppose an individual carries an IDO2-inactivating genotype *and* a KLK15 variant – they might be especially susceptible to a cascade where an infection triggers cytokines (attempting to induce IDO1), but IDO1 cannot properly regulate immunity (due to the trap), resulting in unabated inflammation. That inflammation releases bradykinin and proteases that, if KLK15 is overactive, damage connective tissues and activate mast cells. The mast cells then further drive inflammation (histamine, etc.) and kallikrein activity, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of multi-system dysfunction. While such an “axis” is still theoretical, it underscores how **connective tissue integrity, immune cell activation, and metabolic control are interlinked** in these syndromes. In support of this, many high-quality datasets are converging on a multi-system view: for example, a recent proteomic study identified panels of proteins in ME/CFS patients that included immune regulators, metabolic enzymes, and structural proteins all together, reinforcing that the pathology spans systems ([

## Evidence from Recent Studies and Ongoing Research  
Research into CMSS is rapidly evolving. The **Norris Lab hEDS study (2024)** was a breakthrough, providing the first genetically validated cause of hEDS ([
            Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/#:~:text=cohort%20of%20sporadic%20hEDS%20patients,diagnosis%20and%20better%20clinical%20outcomes)) and opening the door to earlier diagnosis and targeted therapies (e.g. kallikrein inhibitors to protect connective tissue). Concurrently, metabolic research like the **Phair “IDO trap” model (2019)** ([The IDO Metabolic Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS by Robert D. Phair, PhD and Ron Davis, PhD, Stanford Collaboration - Open Medicine Foundation Canada](https://www.omfcanada.ngo/the-ido-metabolic-trap/#:~:text=genetic%20mutations%20that%20were%20common,at%20least%20one%20of%20them)) has prompted clinical investigations into restoring proper tryptophan metabolism in ME/CFS – for instance, trials of amino acid supplements or AHR antagonists to release the trap. In Long COVID, the **eBioMedicine study (2023)** demonstrated the pathological role of sustained IDO2 and even suggested an intervention: since AHR blockade halted IDO2 expression *ex vivo*, AHR inhibitors are being discussed as potential treatments for Long COVID’s neuro-immune symptoms ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=SARS,induced%20symptoms%20and%20pathology)) ([Prolonged indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 activity and associated cellular stress in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection - eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00294-3/fulltext#:~:text=IDO2%20is%20expressed%20in%20blood,2)). Large-scale genomic studies are also underway: the NIH’s Recover initiative for Long COVID and the UK DecodeME project for ME/CFS are collecting DNA from thousands of patients, which will allow genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to detect common variants (perhaps confirming the IDO2 signal or finding new ones). Similarly, the Ehlers-Danlos Society’s HEDGE study (Hypermobile EDS Genetic Evaluation) is expanding on the KLK15 finding by sequencing many hEDS patients ([One Gene Mutation Links Three Mysterious, Debilitating Diseases - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/one-gene-mutation-links-three-mysterious-debilitating-diseases/#:~:text=I%20have%20Ehlers,that%20links%20all%20three%20conditions)). Early results already hint at additional variants in related pathways (e.g. in other ECM proteins or mast-cell regulatory genes). Proteomics and transcriptomics are complementing genetics: for example, **transcriptomic profiles in fibromyalgia** show *Th17 and Type I interferon* pathway activation ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmid/32532082/#:~:text=in%20immunological%20pathways%20connected%20to,genes%20both%20directly%20and%20via)) ([

These high-throughput studies help validate that **the KLK15–IDO axis is not an isolated hypothesis but part of a broader network of dysregulations in CMSS.**

In summary, **KLK15 and IDO1/IDO2 emerge as important biomarkers and genetic factors** in chronic multi-system syndromes. KLK15 mutations compromise the extracellular matrix and provoke inflammatory mediators, offering an explanation for the connective tissue and allergic aspects of conditions like hEDS, POTS, and MCAS. Meanwhile, IDO pathway dysregulation – often rooted in IDO2 genetic variants – can set up a neuro-immune metabolic trap, contributing to the profound fatigue, cognitive issues, and immune anomalies seen in ME/CFS and Long COVID. Ongoing research (including GWAS, multi-omics, and functional studies) is expected to further elucidate this KLK15–IDO axis. In the future, patients could potentially be stratified by these biomarkers – for example, identifying an “IDO2-low subgroup” or a “kallikrein-activation subgroup” – which would enable targeted treatments (such as bradykinin pathway blockers or IDO modulators). The convergence of recent evidence signifies a major step toward unravelling the complex pathogenesis of CMSS and highlights the value of an integrated approach bridging genetic susceptibility with biochemical pathways.
