# Symbolic Attractor Model for Chronic Multi-System Syndromes (GASLIT-AF)

## Overview of the GASLIT-AF Framework
Chronic Multi-System Syndromes (CMSSs) – including conditions like ME/CFS, POTS, hEDS, fibromyalgia, and Long COVID – can be conceptualized as a **pathological attractor state** in a high-dimensional physiological state space ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=thermodynamics%20and%20nonlinear%20dynamics%20,report%20aims%20to%20provide%20a)). In this framework (GASLIT-AF: *Genetic Autonomic Structural Linked Instability Theorem – Allodynic Fatigue*), the chronic illness state is a self-sustaining equilibrium of dysregulation, distinct from the healthy homeostatic state. We model the body as a set of coupled non-linear differential equations representing key interacting subsystems (neuroendocrine, autonomic, immune, and metabolic). The **state vector** resides in a space Ψ spanned by variables for cortisol, inflammation, autonomic tone, cellular energy, oxidative stress, etc., and the chronic syndrome corresponds to an alternative stable equilibrium (attractor) characterized by *high entropy production and low physiological coherence* ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=thermodynamics%20and%20nonlinear%20dynamics%20,report%20aims%20to%20provide%20a)). Small perturbations around an attractor are buffered by feedback loops, making the state resilient (deep “basin of attraction”) and explaining why patients can remain “stuck” in illness. To capture this mathematically, we construct a system of symbolic differential equations with non-linear feedback terms that permit **bistability or multistability** (coexistence of multiple steady-states). Below, we define the state variables, key feedback loops, and present the formal equations and their dynamical implications.

## Variables and Physiological State Space 
We consider a minimal set of state variables capturing the core systems involved in CMSS pathophysiology:

- **$X(t)$ – Cortisol Level:** Represents HPA axis output (glucocorticoid concentration). Cortisol is a stress hormone that modulates metabolism and immune function.  
- **$I(t)$ – Inflammation Level:** Represents systemic inflammatory activity (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration or immune activation level).  
- **$A(t)$ – Autonomic Activation:** Represents the balance of autonomic nervous system activity (high $A$ corresponds to sympathetic dominance and low vagal tone, while lower $A$ would imply more parasympathetic influence).  
- **$E(t)$ – Cellular Energy Availability:** Represents cellular ATP or energy charge available for physiological processes (reflecting mitochondrial function and metabolic capacity).  
- **$O(t)$ – Oxidative Stress:** Represents the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress burden (linked to mitochondrial redox state).  

Additional regulatory elements can be incorporated as needed. For example, **vagal tone** (parasympathetic activity) could be treated as inversely related to $A(t)$, and **receptor sensitivity** (e.g. glucocorticoid receptor functionality) can enter as parameters modulating feedback strengths. We let $\mathbf{X} = (X, I, A, E, O)$ define the system’s state in a 5-dimensional state space $\Psi = \mathbb{R}^5_{\ge 0}$. A physiological *attractor* state is a **stable equilibrium** $\mathbf{X}^*$ of this dynamical system (all $\dot{X}_i=0$ and locally attracting). We are particularly interested in two qualitatively different attractors: (1) a **healthy homeostatic state** (e.g. moderate $X$, low $I$, balanced $A$, high $E$, low $O$), and (2) a **chronic illness state** (e.g. blunted $X$, high $I$, hyperactive $A$, energy-depleted $E$, high $O$) ([Frontiers | The HPA – Immune Axis and the Immunomodulatory Actions of Glucocorticoids in the Brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00136/full#:~:text=other%20hand%2C%20a%20deficient%20or,reviewed%20in)) ([Research progress on pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome and treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine - Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical](https://www.autonomicneuroscience.com/article/S1566-0702(24)00052-3/fulltext#:~:text=regulation%20of%20apoptosis%20,fatigue%2C%20cognitive%20deficits%2C%20mental%20fog)). The model’s nonlinear feedback structure will permit both states to exist under the same parameter regime, with **basins of attraction** determining which state the system settles in. Transitions between attractors correspond to tipping points or bifurcations when feedback loops overwhelm homeostatic control.

**Key Feedback Interactions:** The subsystems are tightly coupled via feedback loops, some of which are self-stabilizing (negative feedback) and others self-reinforcing (positive feedback). The model encodes the following empirically supported interactions:

- **HPA-Immune Coupling:** Cortisol ($X$) has potent *anti-inflammatory* effects, suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines ([Frontiers | The HPA – Immune Axis and the Immunomodulatory Actions of Glucocorticoids in the Brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00136/full#:~:text=Glucocorticoids%20strongly%20influence%20the%20phenotype%2C,inflammatory%20phenotype%20and)). Conversely, chronic inflammation ($I$) can *blunt HPA axis activity* via feedback resistance, leading to insufficient cortisol output ([Frontiers | The HPA – Immune Axis and the Immunomodulatory Actions of Glucocorticoids in the Brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00136/full#:~:text=other%20hand%2C%20a%20deficient%20or,reviewed%20in)). This creates a **mutual inhibition loop** between $X$ and $I$.  
- **Immune-Autonomic Link:** Heightened inflammation activates stress pathways, increasing sympathetic drive ($A$) ([
            The sympathetic nervous response in inflammation - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4396833/#:~:text=Basic%20neuronal%20anti,flow%2C%20but%20also%20increasing%20antigen)). In turn, sustained sympathetic activation (with low vagal tone) can promote a pro-inflammatory state – for example, catecholamines and reduced parasympathetic signaling can **stimulate immune cells** or diminish anti-inflammatory reflexes, thereby further increasing $I$ ([
            The sympathetic nervous response in inflammation - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4396833/#:~:text=Basic%20neuronal%20anti,flow%2C%20but%20also%20increasing%20antigen)) ([The sympathetic nervous response in inflammation | Arthritis Research & Therapy | Full Text](https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-014-0504-2#:~:text=framework%20is%20discussed%20that%20shows,cardiovascular%20mortality%2C%20and%20so%20on)). This forms a **vicious cycle** between $I$ and $A$.  
- **Autonomic-Energy Coupling:** High autonomic activation ($A$), especially sympathetic overdrive, raises metabolic demand (e.g. increasing heart rate, muscle tension, etc.), thus *consuming energy reserves* more rapidly. Chronic stress state ($A$ high) can produce a **catabolic state**, depleting ATP/energy ($E$) and leading to fatigue ([The sympathetic nervous response in inflammation | Arthritis Research & Therapy | Full Text](https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-014-0504-2#:~:text=framework%20is%20discussed%20that%20shows,cardiovascular%20mortality%2C%20and%20so%20on)).  
- **Mitochondrial Dysfunction Loop (Energy-Oxidative):** Impaired mitochondrial function or low cellular energy ($E$ drop) leads to inefficiencies that *increase oxidative stress* ($O$). Excess ROS and oxidative damage ($O$ high) further impair mitochondrial ATP production, reducing $E$ ([Research progress on pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome and treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine - Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical](https://www.autonomicneuroscience.com/article/S1566-0702(24)00052-3/fulltext#:~:text=regulation%20of%20apoptosis%20,fatigue%2C%20cognitive%20deficits%2C%20mental%20fog)). This forms a self-reinforcing **metabolic failure loop** between $E$ and $O$.  
- **Cross-Coupling:** Other cross-links tie these loops together. Oxidative stress $O$ can activate redox-sensitive inflammatory pathways (e.g. NF-κB), contributing to higher $I$. Likewise, low energy $E$ may impair the function of regulatory systems (e.g. reducing the ability of the HPA axis or vagal pathways to respond to stress), indirectly amplifying $I$ and $A$. In our equations, we primarily encode the core interactions listed above, but additional modulators (genetic vulnerability, allostatic load, etc.) will enter as parameters affecting baseline production or sensitivity in each equation.

## Coupled Differential Equations
We propose a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the time-evolution of $(X, I, A, E, O)$. Each ODE term is chosen to reflect a plausible physiological mechanism, using **symbolic variables and parameters** (no specific numerical values assumed). Non-linear terms (such as Hill functions) introduce the possibility of **multi-stable dynamics**, where the system can settle into different stable equilibria (attractors) depending on initial conditions or parameter values. The equations are given as follows:

### HPA Axis (Cortisol $X$) Dynamics
Cortisol is produced by the adrenal glands under stimulation by the HPA axis (CRH→ACTH cascade) and is removed by metabolism and tissue uptake. We model $X(t)$ with a baseline production that is **down-regulated by inflammation** ($I$) and a decay term. A Hill function represents the blunting of cortisol release when inflammatory cytokines are high (e.g. due to reduced pituitary sensitivity in chronic inflammation). The cortisol equation is: 

$$
\frac{dX}{dt} \;=\; \underbrace{P_X\,\frac{1}{1 + \Big(\frac{I}{K_{XI}}\Big)^{n_{XI}}}}_{\substack{\text{HPA production, suppressed if }I\text{ high}\\\text{(inflammation blunts HPA drive)}}}\;+\; \underbrace{S_X\,\frac{\Big(\frac{A}{K_{XA}}\Big)^{m_{XA}}}{1 + \Big(\frac{A}{K_{XA}}\Big)^{m_{XA}}}}_{\substack{\text{stress-induced cortisol}\\\text{from autonomic input (SNS drive)}}}\;-\;\underbrace{\gamma_X\,X}_{\substack{\text{cortisol clearance}\\\text{(metabolic decay)}}} \;. $$

**Explanation:** The term $P_X/(1 + (I/K_{XI})^{n_{XI}})$ is a saturating production rate of cortisol. $P_X$ is the maximum cortisol production rate (under minimal inflammation). When $I$ is low, this term ≈ $P_X$; when $I$ is high, the denominator grows and production is greatly reduced (feedback inhibition by inflammation). This captures the observation that severe or chronic inflammation is associated with a *blunted HPA axis* and low cortisol output ([Frontiers | The HPA – Immune Axis and the Immunomodulatory Actions of Glucocorticoids in the Brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00136/full#:~:text=other%20hand%2C%20a%20deficient%20or,reviewed%20in)). The Hill exponent $n_{XI}>1$ can encode a threshold-like (ultrasensitive) suppression – once $I$ exceeds a certain threshold $K_{XI}$, cortisol production drops off sharply, aiding bistability. The second term $S_X\frac{(A/K_{XA})^{m_{XA}}}{1+(A/K_{XA})^{m_{XA}}}$ represents **stress-induced cortisol release**: high sympathetic activity $A$ (e.g. via catecholamines or CRH neuron stimulation) can drive cortisol up. For simplicity, this is modeled as a saturating stimulatory Hill function of $A$ with maximal effect $S_X$. (If desired, $S_X$ can be set to zero to omit direct $A$ influence; we include it to reflect acute stress inputs to the HPA axis ([Frontiers | The HPA – Immune Axis and the Immunomodulatory Actions of Glucocorticoids in the Brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00136/full#:~:text=Any%20imbalances%20to%20an%20organism,GCs)).) Finally, $-\gamma_X X$ is a first-order decay (clearance rate $\gamma_X$). Cortisol also exerts *autoinhibition* via glucocorticoid receptor feedback, but that fast feedback is implicitly captured by the saturating production term and decay here (explicit receptor dynamics could be added as another equation if needed). 

### Immune/Infection (Inflammation $I$) Dynamics
The inflammatory activity $I(t)$ represents the level of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and active immune cells. It rises due to immune triggers and falls due to anti-inflammatory influences or natural resolution. In our model, $I$ is **suppressed by cortisol** ($X$), and **enhanced by autonomic (sympathetic) activation** ($A$), among other factors. One can also include a self-amplification term to capture positive feedback within the immune system (for example, cytokines that recruit more immune activity). We write the inflammation equation as:

$$
\frac{dI}{dt} \;=\; \underbrace{\rho_I\,\frac{1}{1+\Big(\frac{X}{K_{IX}}\Big)^{n_{IX}}}}_{\substack{\text{pro-inflammatory drive,}\\\text{reduced if cortisol $X$ high}}}\;+\;\underbrace{\sigma_I\,\frac{\Big(\frac{A}{K_{IA}}\Big)^{m_{IA}}}{1+\Big(\frac{A}{K_{IA}}\Big)^{m_{IA}}}}_{\substack{\text{sympathetic-induced}\\\text{inflammation (SNS effect)}}}\;-\;\underbrace{\delta_I\,I}_{\substack{\text{natural decay/resolution}\\\text{of inflammation}}}\;. $$

**Explanation:** The first term $\rho_I/(1+(X/K_{IX})^{n_{IX}})$ represents pro-inflammatory drive (due to infection, tissue damage, etc.) that is held in check when cortisol $X$ is high. Cortisol’s broad anti-inflammatory action is well documented ([Frontiers | The HPA – Immune Axis and the Immunomodulatory Actions of Glucocorticoids in the Brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00136/full#:~:text=The%20anti,hormone%2C%20are%20briefly%20highlighted%20below)); here a high $X$ greatly diminishes the effective $\rho_I$ production. The Hill exponent $n_{IX}$ can create a sharp drop in inflammation once cortisol passes a threshold $K_{IX}$. This term, together with the analogous term in $dX/dt$, establishes the strong **negative cross-talk**: $X$ and $I$ mutually inhibit each other (each via a suppressive Hill function in the other’s production term). This mutual inhibition can yield **bistability** (either $X$ high/$I$ low or $X$ low/$I$ high – see analysis below). The second term $\sigma_I \frac{(A/K_{IA})^{m_{IA}}}{1+(A/K_{IA})^{m_{IA}}}$ models the pro-inflammatory effect of sympathetic overactivity. Chronic stress and low vagal tone are often correlated with elevated inflammatory markers ([
            The sympathetic nervous response in inflammation - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4396833/#:~:text=Basic%20neuronal%20anti,flow%2C%20but%20also%20increasing%20antigen)). Mechanistically, norepinephrine acting on immune organs can *either* inhibit or excite inflammation depending on context ([The sympathetic nervous response in inflammation | Arthritis Research & Therapy | Full Text](https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-014-0504-2#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20decades%20evidence,the%20time%20point%20of%20ongoing)), but in many chronic conditions an **excess SNS drive is associated with higher systemic inflammation** ([The sympathetic nervous response in inflammation | Arthritis Research & Therapy | Full Text](https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-014-0504-2#:~:text=framework%20is%20discussed%20that%20shows,cardiovascular%20mortality%2C%20and%20so%20on)). We capture this by a stimulatory Hill function of $A$ that increases $I$ (with maximal rate $\sigma_I$). Again, $m_{IA}$ can be tuned for nonlinearity. The last term $-\delta_I I$ is a linear clearance/decay representing natural resolution (e.g. cytokine degradation, immune cell apoptosis) in the absence of ongoing drive. 

*Optionally,* one could add a term for **immune self-amplification**, such as a term $\alpha_I \frac{(I/K_{II})^{p}}{1+(I/K_{II})^{p}}$ to reflect that once inflammation is high, it can sustain itself via cytokine cascades. However, in this model many positive feedbacks (I–A loop, E–O loop) already exist, so we have not included an explicit $I$ self-amplification term to avoid redundancy. Autoimmune feedback can be effectively folded into a higher base drive $\rho_I$ or lower $\delta_I$ (slower resolution).

### Autonomic Nervous System ($A$) Dynamics
The autonomic activation variable $A(t)$ represents the net **sympathetic minus parasympathetic** tone. Higher $A$ means sympathetic dominance (fight-or-flight state, high norepinephrine), while lower $A$ (toward zero or negative if extended) would indicate parasympathetic dominance (rest-and-digest state, high vagal tone). For simplicity, we constrain $A \ge 0$ with a baseline resting value near zero; large positive $A$ indicates pathological sympathetic overdrive. $A$ is influenced by multiple factors. We include **excitatory input from inflammation** (via afferent immune signaling to the brain) and a damping term representing the body’s homeostatic adjustments (baroreflex, etc.). We also include a baseline drive that can represent chronic stress input or allostatic load. The $A$ equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} \;=\; \underbrace{\alpha_A + \mu_A\,\frac{\Big(\frac{I}{K_{AI}}\Big)^{n_{AI}}}{1+\Big(\frac{I}{K_{AI}}\Big)^{n_{AI}}}}_{\substack{\text{sympathetic drive: basal ($\alpha_A$) + inflammation-induced}}}\;-\;\underbrace{\beta_A\,(A - A_0)}_{\substack{\text{autonomic relaxation to baseline}\\\text{(baroreflex, vagal braking)}}}\;. $$

**Explanation:** Here $\alpha_A$ is a constant baseline sympathetic drive (which could be zero or a small positive value – it represents persistent allostatic stress input $\Lambda$ ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=production%20and%20low%20physiological%20coherence,report%20aims%20to%20provide%20a)), i.e. cumulative stress load driving the ANS). The term $\mu_A \frac{(I/K_{AI})^{n_{AI}}}{1+(I/K_{AI})^{n_{AI}}}$ captures **immune-driven autonomic activation**: inflammatory mediators (like IL-1, IL-6, TNF) stimulate neural pathways (vagal afferents, hypothalamic receptors) that increase sympathetic outflow ([
            The sympathetic nervous response in inflammation - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4396833/#:~:text=Basic%20neuronal%20anti,flow%2C%20but%20also%20increasing%20antigen)). This is a saturating function that tends to $\mu_A$ at very high $I$. The linear term $-\beta_A (A - A_0)$ brings $A$ back toward a baseline $A_0$ (which might be set to 0 for simplicity, representing the healthy resting tone). This term models the combined effect of negative feedback mechanisms like the baroreflex, which adjusts heart rate and sympathetic output to maintain homeostasis, and the natural decay of adrenaline levels. If $A$ is above baseline, this term is negative (driving $A$ down); if $A$ were below baseline (not common in our scaling, but conceptually if $A< A_0$ meaning parasympathetic overshoot), the term would be positive, pushing $A$ back up. In the chronic illness context, one might set $A_0$ to a slightly elevated value to represent a tendency toward sympathetic bias. We expect $A$ to have a single stable resting point in isolation, but through coupling with $I$ and $E$, $A$ can become persistently elevated in one attractor state (where $I$ is high, continually driving $A$ up) versus moderate in the healthy state.

**Note:** We do not explicitly include a separate equation for **vagal tone** or parasympathetic activity; instead, parasympathetic effects are implicit in the $A$ dynamics (since high $A$ implies low vagal, and the relaxation term $-\beta_A(A-A_0)$ can be seen as parasympathetic/baroreflex influence). A more detailed model could split $A$ into sympathetic and parasympathetic variables, but the single-variable approach suffices for capturing the imbalance.

### Energy Metabolism (Cellular Energy $E$) Dynamics
$E(t)$ represents the available cellular energy (e.g. ATP concentration relative to needs). In a healthy state, $E$ is maintained by mitochondrial ATP production balanced against consumption. In a chronic fatigue or multi-system disorder state, $E$ tends to be low due to mitochondrial dysfunction and sustained high demand. Our equation for $E$ includes: a production term (mitochondrial ATP synthesis) that is **impaired by oxidative stress** ($O$), consumption terms due to **autonomic activity** ($A$) and possibly inflammation, and a baseline recovery term. We propose:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} \;=\; \underbrace{\Pi_E\,\frac{1}{1+\Big(\frac{O}{K_{EO}}\Big)^{n_{EO}}}}_{\substack{\text{ATP production rate, reduced}\\\text{if oxidative stress $O$ is high}}}\;-\;\underbrace{\chi_A\,A \;-\; \chi_I\,I}_{\substack{\text{energy consumption by systems:}\\\text{autonomic + immune work}}}\;-\;\underbrace{\gamma_E\,(E - E_0)}_{\substack{\text{energy usage/restoration to baseline}\\\text{(e.g. basal metabolic rate)}}}\;. $$

**Explanation:** $\Pi_E/(1+(O/K_{EO})^{n_{EO}})$ is the **mitochondrial ATP production rate**, which is maximal $\Pi_E$ when oxidative stress is low, and drops as $O$ increases. This reflects that high ROS can damage mitochondrial enzymes and uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, **limiting ATP generation** ([Research progress on pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome and treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine - Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical](https://www.autonomicneuroscience.com/article/S1566-0702(24)00052-3/fulltext#:~:text=regulation%20of%20apoptosis%20,fatigue%2C%20cognitive%20deficits%2C%20mental%20fog)). A steep $n_{EO}$ would imply a critical threshold of $O$ beyond which energy production collapses. The terms $\chi_A A$ and $\chi_I I$ represent increased ATP consumption due to autonomic activity (e.g. elevated heart rate, muscle tone, etc.) and due to immune/inflammatory activity (e.g. immune cells proliferating, febrile response). These are linear terms for simplicity; if $A$ or $I$ double, energy consumption from that source doubles. In a resting healthy state, $A$ and $I$ are low, so these terms are small; in a flare or stress state, these terms can significantly drain $E$. The last term $-\gamma_E (E - E_0)$ is a restoring term pulling $E$ toward a baseline $E_0$ (the normal ATP level at rest). If $E$ is above $E_0$, this term is negative (using up excess energy or reducing production to maintain homeostasis); if $E$ is below $E_0$, this term is positive (representing mechanisms like increased appetite, rest, or metabolic adjustments to recover energy). Essentially, $\gamma_E$ is the inverse time constant for recovery of energy stores after depletion. For simplicity one might set $E_0=1$ (a normalized energy level) and treat $\gamma_E E$ as a linear usage term (part of basal metabolic consumption).

### Oxidative Stress ($O$) Dynamics
The oxidative stress variable $O(t)$ captures the burden of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and other free radicals. $O$ increases when mitochondrial function is compromised (leaking electrons to form ROS) or when metabolic demands are high, and it decreases via antioxidant defenses and repair processes. In the model, we make $O$ **increase as $E$ falls** (indicating mitochondrial dysfunction and a shift to anaerobic metabolism or inefficient energy production) and we include a baseline decay. The equation for $O$ is formulated as:

$$
\frac{dO}{dt} \;=\; \underbrace{\Omega_O\,\frac{1}{1+\Big(\frac{E}{K_{OE}}\Big)^{n_{OE}}}}_{\substack{\text{ROS generation, higher if $E$ is low}\\\text{(mitochondrial dysfunction feedback)}}}\;+\;\underbrace{\sigma_O\,\frac{\Big(\frac{A}{K_{OA}}\Big)^{m_{OA}}}{1+\Big(\frac{A}{K_{OA}}\Big)^{m_{OA}}}}_{\substack{\text{oxidative stress from high SNS activity}\\\text{(e.g. catecholamine-induced ROS)}}}\;-\;\underbrace{\delta_O\,O}_{\substack{\text{antioxidant clearance}\\\text{of ROS, repair processes}}}\;. $$

**Explanation:** The term $\Omega_O/(1+(E/K_{OE})^{n_{OE}})$ signifies **pathological ROS production when energy is low**. If cellular energy $E$ is plentiful, this term is small (high $E$ in the denominator suppresses it). But if $E$ drops, the fraction approaches $\Omega_O$, meaning maximal ROS generation kicks in. This models the scenario of *bioenergetic failure* – when ATP is insufficient, mitochondria and other sources produce excess oxidative byproducts, contributing to tissue damage. This positive feedback between low $E$ and high $O$ is a known driver in chronic fatigue and metabolic syndrome models ([Research progress on pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome and treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine - Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical](https://www.autonomicneuroscience.com/article/S1566-0702(24)00052-3/fulltext#:~:text=regulation%20of%20apoptosis%20,fatigue%2C%20cognitive%20deficits%2C%20mental%20fog)). The second term $\sigma_O \frac{(A/K_{OA})^{m_{OA}}}{1+(A/K_{OA})^{m_{OA}}}$ is an optional inclusion for **stress-induced oxidative stress** – high sympathetic activity and adrenaline can acutely increase oxidative stress (through increased metabolic rate, NADPH oxidase activation, etc.). We include it for completeness: if $A$ is very high, this term adds up to $\sigma_O$ of additional ROS production. (One could also include an inflammation-driven ROS term, since immune cells produce ROS; however, $I$ and $A$ are correlated in this model, and $A$ already covers many systemic stress effects.) The final term $-\delta_O O$ is a linear removal of oxidative molecules, representing antioxidant systems (glutathione, catalase, etc.) and repair of oxidative damage. $\delta_O$ is the rate at which $O$ is neutralized if no new ROS were produced.

## Attractor Dynamics and Multistability
The above system of equations encodes a complex web of **non-linear feedback loops**. To understand the emergent attractor states, we consider how the feedback loops can reinforce either a healthy equilibrium or a diseased equilibrium:

- In the *healthy attractor*, cortisol $X$ is moderately high, keeping inflammation $I$ low. Low $I$ in turn keeps autonomic drive $A$ at a normal baseline, so energy consumption is not excessive. Adequate energy $E$ supports low oxidative stress $O$, which in turn allows efficient ATP production. This state is a **low-inflammation, high-energy equilibrium** (low entropy production ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=thermodynamics%20and%20nonlinear%20dynamics%20,report%20aims%20to%20provide%20a))). Small perturbations (e.g. a mild infection temporarily raising $I$) will be countered by these feedbacks (cortisol rises, etc.) and the system will return to this equilibrium, indicating it is a stable attractor with a certain basin of attraction. 

- In the *pathological attractor*, a very different self-consistent pattern emerges: **low cortisol, high inflammation, high sympathetic drive, low energy, high oxidative stress** ([Research progress on pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome and treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine - Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical](https://www.autonomicneuroscience.com/article/S1566-0702(24)00052-3/fulltext#:~:text=regulation%20of%20apoptosis%20,fatigue%2C%20cognitive%20deficits%2C%20mental%20fog)). Here, $I$ is elevated and $X$ is suppressed (due to $I$-induced HPA blunting), removing cortisol’s check on inflammation. High $I$ pushes $A$ to stay elevated (sympathetic overactivity), and high $A$ in turn further fuels inflammation and causes heavy energy expenditure. The overtaxed and dysfunctioning mitochondria cannot keep up $E$, so $E$ drops. Low $E$ leads to high $O$ (excess ROS), and high $O$ further impairs energy production, keeping $E$ low. This combination of **mutual reinforcements** locks the system into a dysfunctional state – an attractor corresponding to chronic illness. Notably, this state aligns with clinical observations in conditions like CFS: blunted cortisol (often low or “ineffective” cortisol in chronic inflammation) ([Frontiers | The HPA – Immune Axis and the Immunomodulatory Actions of Glucocorticoids in the Brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00136/full#:~:text=other%20hand%2C%20a%20deficient%20or,reviewed%20in)), systemic inflammation, autonomic dysfunction (e.g. POTS tachycardia), and bioenergetic failure with oxidative stress ([Research progress on pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome and treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine - Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical](https://www.autonomicneuroscience.com/article/S1566-0702(24)00052-3/fulltext#:~:text=regulation%20of%20apoptosis%20,fatigue%2C%20cognitive%20deficits%2C%20mental%20fog)). Once in this attractor, the system tends to remain there; for instance, attempts to reduce inflammation alone might be thwarted by the lack of cortisol and ongoing oxidative mitochondrial issues.

Crucially, the model’s **non-linear terms** (the Hill functions) allow for **bistability**. The mutual inhibitory loop between $X$ and $I$ is analogous to a *toggle switch*: if the anti-inflammatory force ($X$) overwhelms inflammation, the system will settle in the low-$I$ state, but if inflammation wins out, it can suppress $X$ and sustain itself in a high-$I$ state. Similarly, the $E$–$O$ loop has two possible stable regimes (adequate energy vs. energy crash). When all five equations are coupled, these loops interlock, yielding the possibility of multiple simultaneous stable equilibria (and possibly some unstable equilibria that form the boundaries between basins). By tuning parameters, the system can exhibit **multistability** beyond just two states – e.g. an intermediate semi-stable state might exist, or oscillatory dynamics could occur if time delays or higher-order feedback were introduced (though in this static form we expect fixed-point attractors). 

**Attractor Basins:** Each stable equilibrium has a basin of attraction in the state space – the set of initial conditions that will flow to that equilibrium under the dynamics. A schematic attractor landscape can be imagined: a valley representing the healthy state and another valley representing the chronic state. A sufficiently large perturbation (e.g. a major infection, trauma, or cumulative stress load $\alpha_A$ increase) can push the system’s state out of the healthy basin, over a “ridge” (an unstable equilibrium or threshold) and into the illness basin. Once in the illness basin, small perturbations or short-term treatments may not suffice to escape it, since the system will gravitate back to the pathological attractor (this corresponds to the clinical persistence of CMSS symptoms). In our model, the separatrix (boundary) between basins is typically associated with the **unstable middle equilibrium** that arises in a bistable regime (see next section). For example, there may be a threshold level of inflammation $I$ or oxidative stress $O$ beyond which the cortisol/energy feedback can no longer compensate, and the system will slide toward the sick state. This aligns with the concept of *allostatic overload*: beyond a certain point, homeostatic mechanisms break down, and a new stable state is formed.

## Bifurcations and Threshold Conditions 
By analyzing the steady-state equations (setting $\dot{X}=\dot{I}=\dot{A}=\dot{E}=\dot{O}=0$), we can derive conditions for when multiple solutions (equilibria) exist. A **bifurcation** occurs when the number or stability of equilibria changes – for instance, when the healthy and diseased attractors collide and annihilate each other, leaving only one outcome. In this symbolic model, precise bifurcation thresholds can be derived in terms of the parameters, although the full five-dimensional system yields complicated algebra. We can gain insight by examining subsystems:

- **HPA-Immune Subsystem ($X$–$I$):** At equilibrium, from $\dot{X}=0$ and $\dot{I}=0$, we have 
  $$X^* = \frac{P_X}{\gamma_X\Big(1 + \big(\frac{I^*}{K_{XI}}\big)^{n_{XI}}\Big)}, \qquad 
    I^* = \frac{\rho_I}{\delta_I\Big(1 + \big(\frac{X^*}{K_{IX}}\big)^{n_{IX}}\Big)}.$$ 
  Substituting one into the other yields an implicit equation for $X^*$ (or $I^*$). The existence of multiple solutions for $X^*$ typically requires that the inhibitory Hill functions are sufficiently steep. For example, if $n_{XI}$ and $n_{IX}$ are large (cooperative effects) and the maximal product of the nullcline functions is greater than 1, an S-shaped response curve appears. A **saddle-node bifurcation** occurs when the healthy and unhealthy solutions merge, which mathematically corresponds to the discriminant of that implicit equation being zero (or the nullclines being tangent). In simpler terms, a threshold condition might look like: 
  $$\frac{P_X}{\gamma_X} \cdot \frac{\rho_I}{\delta_I} \approx \Theta\left(K_{XI},K_{IX},n_{XI},n_{IX}\right),$$ 
  meaning that if the product of the “open-loop gains” of cortisol and inflammation (production/decay ratios) exceeds a certain function $\Theta$ of the half-saturation constants and Hill exponents, then three solutions (two stable, one unstable) emerge. Solving these equations symbolically, one could derive $\Theta$ explicitly; for example, in the symmetric case $K_{XI}=K_{IX}=K$ and $n_{XI}=n_{IX}=n$, the condition simplifies (the symmetric toggle case has a known bistability criterion related to $P_X P_I$ vs $K$ and exponents). We keep it general here, but importantly, this condition defines the **bifurcation point** where the system switches from monostable (single equilibrium) to bistable (healthy + diseased attractors). Below that threshold, only the healthy state exists (the body can compensate for insults); beyond it, the pathological state appears and can trap the system.

- **Energy-Oxidative Subsystem ($E$–$O$):** Similarly, setting $\dot{E}=0$, $\dot{O}=0$ gives 
  $$E^* = E_0 - \frac{1}{\gamma_E}\Big(\Pi_E\,\frac{1}{1+(O^*/K_{EO})^{n_{EO}}} - \chi_A A^* - \chi_I I^*\Big), \qquad 
    O^* = \frac{\Omega_O}{\delta_O\Big(1 + \big(\frac{E^*}{K_{OE}}\big)^{n_{OE}}\Big)} + \frac{\sigma_O}{\delta_O}\frac{\big(\frac{A^*}{K_{OA}}\big)^{m_{OA}}}{1+(\frac{A^*}{K_{OA}})^{m_{OA}}}.$$ 
  If we momentarily ignore the $A^*$ and $I^*$ inputs (or assume a fixed stress level), the $E$–$O$ subsystem can exhibit bistability due to the positive feedback between $E$ and $O$. A high $O$ drives $E$ low, and low $E$ drives $O$ high – this loop can create two intersection points of the nullclines. A condition for bistability here would involve $\Pi_E$ and $\Omega_O$. For instance, if $\Pi_E$ (max ATP production) is large relative to consumption, the system will have a stable high-$E$/low-$O$ solution; if $\Pi_E$ is too low or $\Omega_O$ (max ROS production at low $E$) is too high, a low-$E$/high-$O$ solution appears. The threshold might be described by: 
  $$\Pi_E \approx \chi_{\text{eff}} + \frac{\gamma_E}{\delta_O}\Omega_O,$$ 
  (where $\chi_{\text{eff}}$ is effective consumption at the bifurcation and the second term is adjusted for ROS clearance). At this point, the two $E$–$O$ equilibria coalesce. Physiologically, this could correspond to a critical mitochondrial impairment or antioxidant depletion beyond which the system cannot maintain energetic homeostasis and crashes into a low-energy state.

- **Full-System Interaction:** In the full 5D system, these subsystems interact, and additional bifurcations can occur. For example, the $X$–$I$–$A$ feedback might introduce a threshold such that above a certain inflammatory drive $\rho_I$ (or a certain chronic stress input $\alpha_A$), the high-inflammation/high-$A$ state becomes the only stable state (the healthy state loses stability via a bifurcation). Likewise, a sufficiently large genetic vulnerability parameter (e.g. weaker HPA responsiveness or lower baseline $E_0$ due to $\gamma$ in GASLIT-AF ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=production%20and%20low%20physiological%20coherence,report%20aims%20to%20provide%20a))) can shrink the healthy basin. We can imagine a **cascade**: initial allostatic load $\Lambda$ increases $A$ baseline; once $A$ is high enough, $I$ starts to climb; if $I$ crosses a threshold, it suppresses $X$ and locks the loop; simultaneously, high $A$ and $I$ strain $E$ and raise $O$; if mitochondria have vulnerability $\gamma$ such that $\Pi_E$ cannot compensate, $E$ crashes and $O$ soars, solidifying the pathological state. Each of these transitions can be seen as passing a bifurcation threshold in a sub-component that pushes the whole system into the new attractor.

In summary, the **symbolic model** presented captures CMSSs as emergent attractor states arising from the interplay of non-linear feedback loops across endocrine (HPA), nervous (ANS), immune, and metabolic subsystems. The model’s equations can be analyzed for equilibria and stability to identify how multiple stable states arise and under what conditions a patient might transition from a normal physiological state to a chronic illness state. The presence of **Hill-function non-linearities** ensures that beyond certain parameter thresholds (e.g. cytokine levels overwhelming cortisol feedback, or oxidative damage overwhelming energy production), the system undergoes **qualitative changes (bifurcations)** leading to a new equilibrium. This formal framework is amenable to mathematical analysis (e.g. phase-plane analysis for subsystems, Jacobian eigenvalue analysis for stability, bifurcation analysis using symbolic algebra) and to computational simulation (one could numerically integrate these ODEs to illustrate the attractor basins). It provides a **theoretical foundation for CMSS as an attractor** in physiological state space, consistent with the GASLIT-AF hypothesis that such chronic conditions represent a stable, self-perpetuating pathological regime rather than a transient deviation ([X](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/fE0MtcqibTdA4MRjwQimgRTjA#:~:text=thermodynamics%20and%20nonlinear%20dynamics%20,report%20aims%20to%20provide%20a)).
