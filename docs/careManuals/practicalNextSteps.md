# Implementing the GASLIT-AF Model: Practical Next Steps

## 1. Diagnostics (Comprehensive Evaluation)  
- **Targeted Lab Tests:** Perform laboratory tests to identify biomarkers of mast cell activation, neuroinflammation, and metabolic issues. This includes **mast cell mediator levels** (serum tryptase, plasma histamine, prostaglandin D₂ and 24-hour urinary N-methylhistamine) to confirm mast cell activation ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=including%20inflammatory%20homeostasis%2C%20tissue%20repair%2C,14)). Check **catecholamine levels** (plasma norepinephrine supine vs. standing) for hyperadrenergic POTS – hyperadrenergic states are indicated by elevated standing norepinephrine ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Around%2030%E2%80%9360,norepinephrine%20clearance%20from%20neuron%20synapses)). An **inflammatory cytokine panel** (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, TGF-β) can assess chronic immune activation; studies show cytokine expression differences in ME/CFS patients that correlate with disease severity ([Inflammation associated with chronic fatigue syndrome | Immunopaedia](https://www.immunopaedia.org.za/breaking-news/2017-articles/inflammation-associated-with-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/#:~:text=Myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic%20fatigue%20syndrome%20,of%20ME%2FCFS%20diagnostics%20and%20therapeutics)). Evaluate **methylation markers** such as homocysteine and folate/B₁₂ levels, since MTHFR or other polymorphisms can impair folate metabolism (leading to high homocysteine) and contribute to connective tissue fragility ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=Folate%20is%20essential%20for%20DNA,tissue%20fragility%20and%20joint%20instability)). Also include a **mitochondrial function screen** (serum lactate, carnitine levels, CoQ10 level) to detect any deficits in cellular energy metabolism, given evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in fatigue syndromes. In addition, perform standard lab work (CBC, metabolic panel, TSH, cortisol) to rule out common causes of fatigue (anemia, thyroid disorder, adrenal insufficiency) ([Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360510#:~:text=many%20other%20health%20problems%2C%20including%3A)).  

- **Autonomic Function Testing:** Refer the patient for a **comprehensive autonomic evaluation**. A head-up **tilt table test** (HUT) is crucial for confirming POTS and orthostatic intolerance ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Diagnosis%20of%20POTS%20requires%20ruling,7%7D%20Treatment%20regimens%20are%20extremely)). Heart rate and blood pressure responses should be measured at intervals; a rise in HR ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes upright (without hypotension) would support a POTS diagnosis ([Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots#:~:text=Postural%20Orthostatic%20Tachycardia%20Syndrome%20,beats%20per%20minute%20in)). **Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis** can quantify autonomic imbalance – POTS patients often show reduced HRV (low high-frequency power, high LF/HF ratio), reflecting increased sympathetic activity and reduced vagal tone ([Resting heart rate variability as a diagnostic marker of cardiovascular dysautonomia in postural tachycardia syndrome](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jbcpp-2022-0069/pdf?srsltid=AfmBOoqZbWzoDacW8QLFBIqXIeFEIM_Ywtqo6_K1ir5g90xev2lTM1hF#:~:text=The%20resting%20heart%20rate%20of,of%20POTS%20and%20its%20severity)). Additional autonomic reflex screening (deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, QSART sweat test) can identify small-fiber neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy contributing to symptoms. If small-fiber neuropathy is suspected (common in fibromyalgia/ME/CFS), consider a **skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density** or quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing, as up to one-third of ME/CFS patients show small-fiber neuropathy which may link to dysautonomia ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=rates%20as%20high%20as%2050)) ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=SFN%20has%20been%20proposed%20as,22%7D%20Although%20treatments%20specifically)).  

- **Imaging and Functional Studies:** Utilize imaging to uncover structural or perfusion issues that might exacerbate dysautonomia or pain. A **brain MRI** can rule out structural lesions (e.g. Chiari malformation or multiple sclerosis) and a **cranio-cervical MRI (with flexion/extension)** can evaluate craniocervical instability or cervical stenosis often associated with connective tissue disorders. For functional assessment, consider **brain perfusion imaging** – research using Doppler and SPECT scans shows that many ME/CFS patients have a significant drop in cerebral blood flow upon upright posture (≈26% reduction vs 7% in healthy controls) ([Worsening Symptoms Is Associated with Larger Cerebral Blood Flow Abnormalities during Tilt-Testing in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)](https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/59/12/2153#:~:text=have%20demonstrated%20that%20extracranial%20Doppler,is%20that%20there%20is%20a)) ([Worsening Symptoms Is Associated with Larger Cerebral Blood Flow Abnormalities during Tilt-Testing in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)](https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/59/12/2153#:~:text=flow,CBF%20reduction%20during%20tilt%20testing)), which can contribute to cognitive fog and fatigue. If cognitive or neuroinflammatory symptoms are prominent, specialized PET imaging or SPECT could be done at research centers to look for neuroinflammation, though these are not routine clinically. A **sleep study (polysomnography)** is advisable to identify any sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnea, restless legs, narcolepsy) that could be compounding fatigue ([Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360510#:~:text=many%20other%20health%20problems%2C%20including%3A)). Unrefreshing sleep is common, and treating an underlying sleep disorder can significantly improve symptoms. Given the history of connective tissue laxity, imaging for **tethered cord or spinal cerebrospinal fluid flow** (upright MRI) might be considered if symptoms suggest occult tethered cord or intracranial hypertension (e.g. headaches, vision changes). Each of these tests can reveal modifiable factors (such as sleep quality or blood flow) that align with the Genetic-Autonomic-Structural instability model.  

- **Genomic and Epigenetic Analysis:** Leverage genomic data for clinically actionable insights. Review the patient’s **polygenic risk profile** to identify high-impact variants: for example, **MTHFR C677T** or other methylation-related polymorphisms (which can elevate homocysteine and oxidative stress, treatable with folate/B₁₂) ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=Folate%20is%20essential%20for%20DNA,tissue%20fragility%20and%20joint%20instability)), or variants in **adrenergic receptor genes** (which might explain hyperadrenergic tendencies). While routine whole-genome sequencing is not standard for these syndromes, targeted genetic testing is warranted to rule out known monogenic conditions that can mimic the phenotype – e.g. **COL3A1 gene testing** for vascular EDS if there are red flags (vascular rupture, family history), **FBN1/TGFBR1** if features of Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndromes are present, etc. If not already done, confirm the **Ehlers-Danlos subtype**: hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is clinically diagnosed, but classical or other types have genetic tests. **Epigenetic or gene expression panels** (available in some specialty labs) might identify patterns of immune or mitochondrial gene activation; for instance, an NK cell function test or gene expression signature could support an ME/CFS diagnosis (research has shown distinctive gene expression and cytokine profiles in these patients ([Inflammation associated with chronic fatigue syndrome | Immunopaedia](https://www.immunopaedia.org.za/breaking-news/2017-articles/inflammation-associated-with-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/#:~:text=Myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic%20fatigue%20syndrome%20,of%20ME%2FCFS%20diagnostics%20and%20therapeutics))). Although many genomic/epigenetic findings are emerging research tools, a consultation with an integrative genomics specialist or genetic counselor can help interpret the patient’s data and prioritize any findings that have established interventions (such as supplementing a deficient metabolic pathway or increased surveillance for a connective tissue gene variant). In summary, the diagnostic work-up should be broad but focused, aiming to document the patient’s biologic “fingerprints” of GASLIT-AF – mast cell mediators, autonomic biomarkers, structural integrity, and genetic predispositions – which will guide targeted therapy.  

## 2. Pharmacologic and Supplement Interventions  
- **Mast Cell Stabilization and Allergy Control:** Given the signs of mast cell activation (MCAS), initiate therapies to stabilize mast cells and reduce mediator release. First-line treatment is avoidance of known triggers and use of **H₁/H₂ antihistamines**: non-sedating H₁-blockers (cetirizine, fexofenadine) combined with H₂ blockers (famotidine, ranitidine) can relieve histamine-driven symptoms (flushing, urticaria, GI distress) ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Therapies%20directed%20towards%20mast%20cell,78)). Add a **mast cell stabilizer** such as cromolyn sodium (oral, before meals) or ketotifen (which has combined H₁-blocking and mast-cell stabilizing properties) to reduce degranulation ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Therapies%20directed%20towards%20mast%20cell,78)). Leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast) are also beneficial, especially for MCAS patients with respiratory or sinus symptoms ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Therapies%20directed%20towards%20mast%20cell,78)). For severe or refractory cases, consider advanced therapies like **omalizumab** (anti-IgE monoclonal antibody) or **Ketotifen** (compounded in higher doses) as adjuncts – these have anecdotal success in difficult MCAS. Ensuring adequate **Vitamin D** levels is also important, as Vitamin D helps stabilize mast cells and reduce histamine release ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=with%20hEDS%2C%20POTS%2C%20and%20MCAS%2C,Additionally%2C%20%2010)). If serum 25(OH)D is low, supplement to mid-normal range (while monitoring calcium), since deficiency is common and can exacerbate both immune dysregulation and orthostatic intolerance ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20plays%20a%20critical,Additionally%2C%20%2010)). In summary, a regimen of antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, and possibly leukotriene inhibitors forms the pharmacologic cornerstone for the MCAS component, aiming to quell the hyperactive allergic/inflammatory response.  

- **Autonomic Modulation (POTS Therapies):** To address orthostatic intolerance and hyperadrenergic states, employ medications that support hemodynamics and reduce sympathetic overdrive. If the patient has low blood volume or pooling, a **fludrocortisone** trial can be useful – this mineralocorticoid expands plasma volume and has shown efficacy in improving POTS symptoms ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20salt%20supplementation%2C,but%20requires%20frequent%20complete%20blood)) (monitor blood pressure and electrolytes during use). For immediate relief of orthostatic tachycardia or near-syncope episodes, use **midodrine**, an alpha-1 agonist vasopressor that raises standing blood pressure by improving peripheral vasoconstriction ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Midodrine%2C%20an%20%CE%B1_%7B1%7D,5%2C8)). (Note: dose during daytime only, as it can cause supine hypertension ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Midodrine%2C%20an%20%CE%B1_%7B1%7D,65%7D%20Droxidopa%20is%20a)).) In hyperadrenergic POTS (documented by high standing norepinephrine), low-dose **beta blockers** (e.g. propranolol or long-acting metoprolol) can blunt the adrenergic surge and reduce heart rate and tremulousness ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=%CE%B2,Verapamil%2C%20in)) ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=al,7)). Ivabradine, a sinus node inhibitor that lowers heart rate without affecting blood pressure, has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in hyperadrenergic POTS patients ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Ivabradine%2C%20a%20drug%20approved%20by,found%20that)) ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=reduced%20ejection%20fraction%2C%20is%20being,70)). **Pyridostigmine** (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) is another option to enhance parasympathetic tone; it’s been found to improve fatigue and presyncope in POTS by attenuating heart rate through increased vagal activity ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Pyridostigmine%20acts%20to%20inhibit%20acetylcholinesterase%2C,side%20effect%20of%20this%20therapy)). For patients with prominent blood pooling in the abdomen or legs, consider **droxidopa** (a norepinephrine precursor) or even low-dose **stimulants** like methylphenidate/modafinil for their vasoconstrictive and alerting effects ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=intramuscular%20injection%2C%20which%20may%20limit,5%2C65)) ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=vasoconstriction%20peripherally%20with%20minimal%20effects,5%2C65)) (modafinil can help brain fog but use cautiously as it may raise BP). If sympathetic overactivity remains an issue, central sympatholytics such as **clonidine** or **methyldopa** at low doses (especially at night) can calm the adrenergic state – these are better tolerated in hyperadrenergic POTS subtypes ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Medications%20That%20Target%20Sympathetic%20Activity)). Many POTS medications are off-label and should be tailored to the patient’s subtype and tolerances ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20no%20Food,about%20the%20risks%20and%20benefits)), often requiring trial-and-error. The goal is to improve orthostatic vitals and symptoms like dizziness, palpitations, and presyncope, thereby increasing upright tolerance and daily function.  

- **Pain and Neuroinflammation Management:** For chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia-like) and neuroinflammatory symptoms (headaches, brain fog), a multifaceted approach is recommended. Low-dose **naltrexone (LDN)** is an increasingly popular off-label therapy that can modulate neuroglial activation and reduce pain. LDN (e.g. 1.5–4.5 mg at night) has shown benefit across similar conditions – it has helped patients with fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, POTS, and MCAS by reducing central inflammation and pain signaling ([Overlapping conditions in Long COVID at a multisite academic center](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1482917/pdf#:~:text=be%C2%A0harnessed%20for%20LC%20%28149%29,may%20be%C2%A0%20secondary%20to%20neuroimmune)). Given the patient’s neuroinflammatory risk, LDN is a reasonable, low-risk intervention to attempt for pain, fatigue, and even mast cell mitigation. For fibromyalgia-type pain, consider **tricyclics or SNRIs** (amitriptyline, duloxetine) or **anticonvulsants** (pregabalin, gabapentin) as per fibromyalgia guidelines – these can improve pain and sleep, though start low to avoid intolerance. If headaches or migraine are an issue (common in dysautonomia), therapies like **tricyclics (nortriptyline)** or **beta-blockers** can serve dual purpose for headache prophylaxis and POTS. **NSAIDs** or acetaminophen can be used for symptomatic relief, but often they are not very effective for central pain; instead, trial of **muscle relaxants** at night (cyclobenzaprine low dose, which also has fibromyalgia evidence) can improve sleep quality and myalgias. To address possible neuroimmune activation, some clinicians might employ short courses of **glucocorticoids** or **NSAIDs** during flare-ups of inflammation, though long-term use is limited. In more severe neuroinflammatory presentations or if there’s evidence of autoimmune small-fiber neuropathy (e.g. positive autoantibodies or biopsy-proven), **immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG or SCIG)** can be considered – case reports show IVIG improved symptoms in patients with POTS plus autoimmune features ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=For%20patients%20with%20autoimmune,reported%20symptoms.%5E%7B32)). Another emerging route for recalcitrant cases is **plasmapheresis** to remove autoantibodies; this has shown anecdotal benefit in autoimmune POTS ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=For%20patients%20with%20autoimmune,reported%20symptoms.%5E%7B32)). These aggressive immunotherapies would typically be managed by a neurologist or neuroimmunologist if the evidence (e.g. neural antibodies to adrenergic or acetylcholine receptors) justifies it. Overall, integrating a regimen like LDN for central inflammation, plus fibromyalgia-oriented medications for pain and sleep, will address the “allodynia” and neuroinflammation aspect of GASLIT-AF. The emphasis is on improving quality of life by reducing pain hypersensitivity, headaches, and cognitive fog.  

- **Mitochondrial and Metabolic Support:** Given the patient’s polygenic risk for mitochondrial dysfunction and the profound fatigue, augmenting cellular energy production is crucial. **Coenzyme Q10** supplementation is a foundational therapy – CoQ10 is a mitochondrial cofactor often found to be low in chronic fatigue states, and multiple randomized trials have shown CoQ10 can significantly reduce fatigue in patients (meta-analysis indicates a notable improvement in fatigue scores vs placebo) ([
            Effectiveness of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation for Reducing Fatigue: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9449413/#:~:text=we%20conducted%20this%20meta,the%20healthy%20and%20diseased%20participants)). A typical dose is 100–300 mg daily (ubiquinol form if possible). Along with CoQ10, consider **NAD⁺ precursors** (such as nicotinamide riboside or NMN) and **L-carnitine** supplementation, as these support mitochondrial oxidation of fats and may improve energy (small studies in CFS/FMS have suggested benefit to fatigue when combining NADH and CoQ10 ([Effect of coenzyme Q10 plus nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561415001892#:~:text=,levels%20and%20other%20symptoms))). **Magnesium** is another key nutrient – it’s a cofactor in ATP production and nerve function, and deficiency can worsen muscle pain, cramps, and mast cell activation ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=Magnesium%20is%20essential%20for%20nerve,related%20symptoms)) ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=fatigue%2C%20and%20cardiovascular%20issues%20in,related%20symptoms)). Ensure repletion of magnesium (e.g. magnesium glycinate or magnesium L-threonate for better absorption) if levels are low-normal or deficient. The same applies for **Vitamin B12** and **folate**: B12 is vital for nerve health and energy, and many POTS/EDS patients have low B12 (due to gastroparesis or malabsorption) leading to fatigue and cognitive trouble ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=Vitamin%20B12%20is%20vital%20for,the%20manifestations%20of%20these%20disorders)) ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=Testing%20and%20Treatment%3A%20Serum%20vitamin,for%20those%20with%20absorption%20issues)). Treat any B12 deficiency aggressively (injections or high-dose sublingual) and supplement with active folate (5-MTHF) especially if MTHFR mutations are present, to optimize methylation and reduce homocysteine ([Nutrient Considerations in EDS, MCAS, POTS, and other Neuroimmune Conditions | The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/nutrient-considerations-in-eds-mcas-pots-and-other-neuroimmune-conditions#:~:text=Folate%20is%20essential%20for%20DNA,tissue%20fragility%20and%20joint%20instability)). **Antioxidants** such as **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)** and **alpha-lipoic acid** can be added to help combat oxidative stress that accompanies mitochondrial dysfunction and MCAS; these also support glutathione production. In practice, a mitochondrial support “cocktail” might include CoQ10, L-carnitine, NADH/NAD⁺ booster, magnesium, B-complex (with B1, B2, B6, B12, folate), and antioxidants (Vitamin C, NAC, alpha lipoic acid). These nutraceuticals are generally safe and evidence suggests they can improve fatigue, exercise tolerance, and even pain in fibromyalgia and ME/CFS ([The Present (and Future) CoQ10 for Fibromyalgia and Chronic ...](https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2020/11/19/coq10-fibromyalgia-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-review/#:~:text=The%20Present%20,morning%20tiredness%20most%20prominently%20occurring)) ([
            Effectiveness of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation for Reducing Fatigue: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9449413/#:~:text=we%20conducted%20this%20meta,the%20healthy%20and%20diseased%20participants)). It’s wise to introduce supplements one by one to gauge benefit and tolerance. Over months, this metabolic support can enhance the patient’s baseline energy and resiliency, addressing the “fatigue” component of Allodynic Fatigue at the cellular level.  

## 3. Non-Pharmacologic Therapies  
- **Autonomic Rehabilitation and Vagal Nerve Stimulation:** Non-drug approaches to rebalance the autonomic nervous system are a key part of the GASLIT-AF strategy. One promising intervention is **vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)** to enhance parasympathetic activity and reduce sympathetic overdrive. Recent evidence from a sham-controlled trial in POTS demonstrated that daily transcutaneous VNS (ear clip stimulation) for 2 months significantly reduced orthostatic tachycardia (average 17 bpm increase with VNS vs 32 bpm in sham) and even lowered pathogenic autoantibody levels against adrenergic receptors ([Vagus Nerve Stimulation for POTS | Natural Medicine Journal](https://www.naturalmedicinejournal.com/journal/vagus-nerve-stimulation#:~:text=Key%20Findings)). Patients also had reductions in inflammatory cytokine TNF-α with VNS ([Vagus Nerve Stimulation for POTS | Natural Medicine Journal](https://www.naturalmedicinejournal.com/journal/vagus-nerve-stimulation#:~:text=minute%2C%20respectively%20%28P%3D0)). This suggests vagal stimulation can directly dampen the hyperadrenergic and inflammatory components. While FDA-approved implantable VNS devices are indicated for epilepsy/depression, we can utilize **non-invasive VNS** (such as a gammaCore or transcutaneous auricular VNS unit) under medical supervision for this patient. Teaching the patient **vagal maneuvers** (deep slow breathing, gag reflex activation, carotid sinus massage with caution, etc.) can provide on-demand autonomic calming during acute episodes of tachycardia or anxiety. In parallel, **graded exercise therapy** is *not* appropriate (due to risk of post-exertional crashes), but **gentle conditioning within the patient’s energy envelope** is important. A **structured exercise program** focusing on recumbent exercises (rowing, recumbent bike, swimming) and **very gradual increase** in activity can improve autonomic tone over time ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=cardiac%20blood%20return.,33)). Many POTS patients benefit from **exercise training** to recondition the heart and improve upright tolerance, but it must be done cautiously to avoid flares ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=cardiac%20blood%20return.,33)). **Tilt-training** (repeated short periods of standing against a wall or using a tilt table to build tolerance) is another strategy used in some autonomic clinics. The patient should also practice **hydration and salt loading** (e.g. 2–3 L fluid and 5–10 g extra salt per day if tolerated) as a non-pharmacologic cornerstone for orthostatic symptoms ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Medications%20That%20Target%20Hypovolemia)) – this can be facilitated by drinking electrolyte solutions and using salt tablets. Overall, these autonomic rehab measures (vagal stimulation, gentle aerobic conditioning, volume expansion) aim to reset the autonomic balance towards normal. Regular **heart rate variability biofeedback** or meditation can augment this by training increased vagal tone; HRV biofeedback has shown promise in dysautonomia by improving the autonomic reflex control ([How Can HRV Biofeedback Help With Dysautonomia? - Lief Blog](https://blog.getlief.com/how-can-hrv-biofeedback-help-with-dysautonomia/#:~:text=How%20Can%20HRV%20Biofeedback%20Help,to%20better%20regulate%20heart)) ([Resting heart rate variability as a diagnostic marker of cardiovascular dysautonomia in postural tachycardia syndrome](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jbcpp-2022-0069/pdf?srsltid=AfmBOoqZbWzoDacW8QLFBIqXIeFEIM_Ywtqo6_K1ir5g90xev2lTM1hF#:~:text=Postural%20orthostatic%20tachycardia%20syndrome%20,risk%20in%20patients%20with%20POTS)). By combining technology-based stimulation with lifestyle practices, we target the “autonomic” piece of the syndrome in a sustainable way.

- **Physical Therapy and Proprioceptive Training:** Engage the patient in specialized **physical therapy** geared towards connective tissue instability (hEDS) and orthostasis. A physical therapist or occupational therapist with experience in hypermobility syndromes should guide **proprioceptive exercises** to improve joint position sense and muscle coordination ([](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2018-EDS-Webinar-Chopra.pdf#:~:text=Proprioception%20exercises%20%E2%80%A2%20Balance%20board,SUP)) ([](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2018-EDS-Webinar-Chopra.pdf#:~:text=Proprioception%20exercises%20%E2%80%A2%20Juggling%20%E2%80%A2,stand%20on%20one%20leg)). For example, exercises using balance boards, single-leg stands, and resistance bands can train joint-stabilizing muscles. Strengthening the core and **postural muscles** is vital to support lax ligaments – this can alleviate strain on the spine and potentially reduce POTS symptoms (since a stronger muscle pump helps venous return). The use of **bracing or compression garments** during therapy can provide joint support and sensory feedback: wearing snug supports (e.g. ankle braces, kinesio tape, or even tight clothing) improves proprioceptive input to the brain ([](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2018-EDS-Webinar-Chopra.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L978%20%E2%80%A2%20Braces,strength%20Pradeep%20Chopra%2C%20MD%2083)) ([](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2018-EDS-Webinar-Chopra.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L2059%20Proprioception%20%E2%80%93,limbs%20will%20help%20the%20brain)), helping the patient sense limb position and move more confidently. **Compression stockings (30–40 mmHg)** up to the thigh or waist are recommended for POTS to reduce blood pooling ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Compression%20stockings%20are%20useful%20for,9)); these can significantly reduce dizziness by improving venous return. An abdominal binder is another tool for orthostatic intolerance, especially if abdominal pooling is suspected ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Compression%20stockings%20are%20useful%20for,9)). The patient should be taught **safe exercise techniques** that avoid joint subluxations – low-impact strengthening and **aquatic therapy** (water provides gentle resistance and joint support) can be excellent. **Pacing and “energy envelope” management** should be reinforced during PT: the patient must learn to stop before overexertion (to prevent post-exertional malaise). Short, frequent activity intervals with rest (interval training approach) may allow some conditioning without crashes. Over time, physical therapy will not only improve musculoskeletal stability (addressing the “Structural Linked Instability”) but also condition the cardiovascular reflexes to mitigate POTS. Success can be measured by reduced joint pain, fewer subluxations, and improved tolerance for upright activities.  

- **Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies:** While the syndrome is biomedical, addressing the **mental health and neurocognitive aspect** is important for coping and overall function. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** can be offered as supportive therapy – not to imply the illness is psychological, but to help the patient manage stress, anxiety, and to develop pacing strategies. Notably, updated guidelines emphasize that CBT is *not* a cure for ME/CFS; instead, it can improve coping and quality of life as an adjunct ([NICE 2021 Criteria for ME/CFS](https://www.meresearch.org.uk/research/nice-criteria/#:~:text=2,%E2%80%9D)). In practice, a therapist can work with the patient on pain coping skills, relaxation techniques, and cognitive strategies to handle “brain fog” (e.g. memory aids, structured routines). If the patient has any trauma or anxiety related to illness (which is common after years of being unwell or dismissed), trauma-informed therapy or support groups can be beneficial. **Pain reprocessing therapy (PRT)** is an emerging behavioral approach that has shown remarkable results in chronic pain by retraining the brain’s interpretation of pain signals. While still experimental in conditions like fibromyalgia, one trial in chronic back pain showed PRT eliminated pain in a majority of patients by targeting central pain pathways. Introducing the patient to the concepts of neuroplasticity and guided pain visualization (through programs like Alan Gordon’s PRT or the Curable app) might help reduce the “pain volume.” Similarly, **neural retraining programs** (such as DNRS or the Gupta Program) have anecdotal success in limbic-system hypersensitivity syndromes (like chemical sensitivities, some cases of ME/CFS). These involve brain exercises to down-regulate fight-or-flight responses and could complement other treatments by calming the nervous system’s threat response. For cognitive symptoms and dysautonomia, **biofeedback and neurofeedback** can be useful: EEG neurofeedback training has been shown to significantly improve fibromyalgia symptoms (reducing pain severity, improving sleep and cognitive function in RCTs) ([Effects of Neurofeedback on Fibromyalgia: A Randomized Controlled Trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33579615/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20%20An%208,attention%20in%20patients%20with%20fibromyalgia)). A course of neurofeedback sessions might help normalize brain wave patterns associated with fatigue or “brain fog,” thereby enhancing concentration and sleep quality. **Meditation and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)** techniques are likewise recommended to lower stress, which can trigger mast cells and dysautonomia. If the patient struggles with unrefreshing sleep, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can be employed to instill good sleep hygiene and routines. Overall, these therapies aim to improve the patient’s mental resilience and reduce the amplification of symptoms by the central nervous system. They are supportive modalities that, in combination, tackle the “allodynia” (heightened sensitivity) and improve the patient’s ability to manage daily life with a chronic condition.

- **Lifestyle and Environmental Adjustments:** Advise a series of lifestyle modifications to create an environment conducive to healing and to minimize flare-ups. **Activity Pacing** is paramount: educate the patient on the concept of the “energy envelope” – balancing activity with rest to avoid crashes. They should employ a heart-rate monitor or a fatigue scale to stay below the threshold that provokes post-exertional malaise ([Overlapping conditions in Long COVID at a multisite academic center](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1482917/pdf#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20people%20with%20LC,Screening%20for%20hypermobile%20tendencies%20may)). Structured rest periods throughout the day and a relatively fixed routine help prevent boom-bust cycles. **Sleep hygiene** must be optimized since disordered sleep worsens fatigue and pain. Encourage a consistent sleep schedule, a dark cool bedroom, and avoidance of screens before bed; if insomnia is severe, natural sleep aids (melatonin, magnesium) or prescription low-dose sedatives can be used short-term. **Dietary adjustments** can be very beneficial: a **low-histamine diet** (avoiding aged cheeses, alcohol, fermented foods) may reduce baseline mast cell activation for MCAS patients. Some patients find an **anti-inflammatory diet** (rich in omega-3s, antioxidants, and low in processed carbs) helps reduce pain and brain fog. Ensure adequate protein and salt intake for orthostatic intolerance, and consider small frequent meals if blood pressure or GI symptoms fluctuate with large meals. Because connective tissue and mast cell issues can be exacerbated by estrogen, women may notice cyclic symptom changes – coordinating with an endocrinologist or gynecologist for hormonal management (e.g. stabilizing estrogen/progesterone levels) might be another angle if there’s a clear pattern. **Environmental control** is also important: many such patients have sensory hypersensitivity (to light, sound, chemicals). Advise creating a **sensory-friendly environment** – for example, using noise-cancelling headphones or sunglasses in overstimulating settings, avoiding harsh chemicals/fragrances in the home, and possibly using air purifiers if there are allergen triggers. Temperature extremes can trigger POTS episodes, so maintaining a moderate ambient temperature and wearing cooling vests or having a fan in hot weather can prevent symptom flares. **Orthostatic accommodations** at home and work should be made: e.g., elevate the head of the bed by 4–6 inches to reduce morning orthostatic shock, use shower chairs and take lukewarm (not hot) showers to avoid vasodilation. The patient should be encouraged to prioritize **stress management** – chronic illness is itself a stressor that can worsen autonomic symptoms. Gentle yoga (within tolerance), meditation, breathing exercises, or tai chi can all help tone the vagus nerve and reduce stress. **Peer support** is another non-pharmacologic boon: connecting with support groups (online forums for ME/CFS, EDS, POTS, or local patient groups) can provide emotional support and practical tips. By implementing these lifestyle adjustments, the patient gains a sense of control over triggers and can significantly reduce the day-to-day symptom burden. The theme is to create stability and reduce “instability” in daily routines – aligning with the GASLIT model’s focus on minimizing physiological stressors on a fragile system.  

## 4. Specialist Referrals and Resources  
- **Multidisciplinary Specialist Team:** This patient’s complex syndrome spans multiple specialties, so coordinated care is essential. Key referrals include: **Autonomic Neurology or Cardiology** for POTS (many academic centers have autonomic dysfunction clinics that can do advanced testing and help manage refractory orthostatic intolerance). A cardiologist/electrophysiologist familiar with POTS can supervise tilt-table testing and prescribe advanced therapies ([What is the Dysautonomia Trifecta? (EDS, POTS, and MCAS)](https://www.engagebrainbodybetter.com/post/what-is-the-dysautonomia-trifecta-eds-pots-and-mcas#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Dysautonomia%20Trifecta%3F,for%20MCAS)). **Allergist/Immunologist** for Mast Cell Activation Syndrome – they can help with advanced MCAS treatments (e.g. high-dose antihistamines, omalizumab, or workup for systemic mastocytosis if indicated) ([What is the Dysautonomia Trifecta? (EDS, POTS, and MCAS)](https://www.engagebrainbodybetter.com/post/what-is-the-dysautonomia-trifecta-eds-pots-and-mcas#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Dysautonomia%20Trifecta%3F,for%20MCAS)). **Rheumatologist or Geneticist** for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a rheumatologist can document joint hypermobility and manage pain/joint issues, while a medical geneticist can evaluate for other hereditary disorders and coordinate genetic testing ([What is the Dysautonomia Trifecta? (EDS, POTS, and MCAS)](https://www.engagebrainbodybetter.com/post/what-is-the-dysautonomia-trifecta-eds-pots-and-mcas#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Dysautonomia%20Trifecta%3F,for%20MCAS)). Given the neuroinflammatory aspects, a **Neuroimmunologist** or **Neurologist** who specializes in conditions like small-fiber neuropathy or chronic fatigue syndrome would be valuable – for example, some neurologists focus on autoimmune encephalopathies and could evaluate the patient for neural autoantibodies or encephalitis syndromes that might respond to immune therapy. If cognitive impairment is significant, a **Neuropsychologist** can do cognitive testing and rehabilitation strategies. Because of the overlap with endocrine/metabolic issues (e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction, dysautonomia can involve adrenal abnormalities), involving an **Endocrinologist** for adrenal, thyroid, or metabolic evaluation is prudent (some POTS patients benefit from fludrocortisone or midodrine which endocrinology can assist with). A **Pain Management** specialist or physiatrist (PM&R physician) should be involved for fibromyalgia and chronic pain – interventions like trigger point injections, low-dose naltrexone oversight, or even ketamine infusions could be considered by pain specialists for refractory pain. **Gastroenterology** input might be needed if there's IBS or gastroparesis (common in EDS/POTS) – a GI can help treat SIBO, malabsorption, or nutritional deficiencies. In summary, expect to assemble a team that includes (at minimum) Neurology, Cardiology, Rheumatology/Genetics, Immunology, and Pain Management, with others co-opted as needed. Ideally, these providers communicate with each other – consider having a case conference or using a center that offers integrated multidisciplinary clinics. This echoes the Ehlers-Danlos Society’s **Center of Excellence model**, which calls for specialized teams including pain, dysautonomia, rehabilitation, GI, neurology, neurosurgery, gynecology, mental health and more, all up-to-date on these syndromes ([The Ehlers-Danlos Society announces Center of Excellence Program - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/the-ehlers-danlos-society-announces-center-of-excellence-program/#:~:text=globe)). While accessing such a comprehensive center may be challenging, the goal is to approximate that level of coordinated care via referrals and information-sharing.  

- **Centers of Excellence & Clinical Networks:** Guide the patient toward centers and clinicians with specific expertise in overlapping conditions. For example, the **Vanderbilt Autonomic Dysfunction Center** or **Mayo Clinic Autonomic Laboratory** are renowned for evaluating POTS and autonomic disorders. The **Bateman Horne Center** (Salt Lake City) specializes in ME/CFS and fibromyalgia and could provide advanced care or research trial opportunities. Some academic hospitals (e.g. Johns Hopkins, Stanford, Mt. Sinai) have **NeuroCOVID or Chronic Fatigue clinics** now, stemming from Long COVID initiatives, which also treat ME/CFS, POTS, and related syndromes with a comprehensive approach ([Overlapping conditions in Long COVID at a multisite academic center](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1482917/pdf#:~:text=with%20LC%20may%20find%20symptom,Other)) ([Overlapping conditions in Long COVID at a multisite academic center](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1482917/pdf#:~:text=148%29,can%20fibromyalgia%20medications%20for%20pain)). The patient may benefit from evaluation at one of these if local care stalls. The **Ehlers-Danlos Society** is establishing Centers of Excellence globally ([The Ehlers-Danlos Society announces Center of Excellence Program - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/the-ehlers-danlos-society-announces-center-of-excellence-program/#:~:text=The%20Ehlers,and%20HSD%20around%20the%20globe)) ([The Ehlers-Danlos Society announces Center of Excellence Program - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/the-ehlers-danlos-society-announces-center-of-excellence-program/#:~:text=globe)) – checking their website for any designated center or knowledgeable provider in the patient’s region (Ohio area) could yield leads. Additionally, the society’s **Healthcare Professionals Directory** can help find local EDS-savvy physicians ([The Ehlers-Danlos Society announces Center of Excellence Program - The Ehlers Danlos Society](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/the-ehlers-danlos-society-announces-center-of-excellence-program/#:~:text=,Medical%20and%20Scientific%20Board)). **Dysautonomia International** (a patient advocacy group) provides a “find a physician” resource listing POTS specialists by state, which can help identify an autonomic neurologist or cardiologist near the patient. For MCAS, organizations like **The Mast Cell Disease Society (TMS)** list specialists in mast cell disorders – often immunologists or hematologists who understand MCAS. Encourage the patient to tap into these networks: often these groups host conferences, webinars or patient forums that share cutting-edge management strategies. There are also integrative clinics (for instance, the **Metrodora Institute** in Utah, a new center focusing on neuroimmune disorders like ME/CFS, POTS, and autoimmune encephalopathies ([Metrodora - a High-Tech Clinical / Research Center for ME/CFS, FM ...](https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2023/07/26/metrodora-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-fibromyalgia-pots-long-covid/#:~:text=,The%20title))) which combine research and clinical care – such centers might have trials or novel therapies. It’s worth checking if the patient qualifies for any **clinical trials** in their area or nationally. As of now (2025), there are ongoing trials for interventions like **AMPK modulators, cytokine blockers, and novel antivirals** in ME/CFS, **BC007 and IVIG** in post-COVID POTS (targeting autoantibodies), and **vagus nerve stimulation** in Long COVID/fibromyalgia ([Vagus Nerve Stimulation in ME/CFS, FM, POTS and Long COVID](https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2022/12/17/vagus-nerve-stimulation-chronic-fatigue-fm-pots-long-covid/#:~:text=COVID%20www,improve%20symptoms%2C%20and%20reduce)) ([Vagus nerve stimulators for POTS, fatigue, and long haul COVID](https://www.drcourtneycraig.com/blog/vagus-nerve-stimulator-fatigue-pots-covid#:~:text=Vagus%20nerve%20stimulators%20for%20POTS%2C,While%20fatigue)). The patient’s profile (hyperadrenergic, neuroinflammatory) might match trials investigating **beta-adrenergic autoantibody removal** or **immune modulation**. Collaborating with a research center could give access to therapies like investigational immunomodulators, or at least contribute data to the evolving understanding. Provide the patient with resources to stay informed: the **Solve ME/CFS Initiative** and **Open Medicine Foundation** share updates on research and sometimes facilitate patient enrollment in studies. Similarly, **clinical guidelines and consensus statements** can inform local doctors – for instance, share the 2021 **NICE guideline for ME/CFS** (which outlines pacing and cautions against unhelpful therapies) and the recent **consensus on POTS management** with the care team ([NICE 2021 Criteria for ME/CFS](https://www.meresearch.org.uk/research/nice-criteria/#:~:text=2,%E2%80%9D)) ([POTS-associated Conditions and Management Strategies | USC Journal](https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/narrative-review-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-associated-conditions-and?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=Therapies%20directed%20towards%20mast%20cell,78)). This will back up the rationale for the chosen interventions. Ultimately, plugging the patient into specialized care networks and research not only provides them expert management, but also psychosocial support – they will feel less “alone” and “mysterious” as they connect with professionals and peers who understand these overlapping conditions.

- **Patient Education and Support Resources:** Empower the patient with knowledge and community. Provide reputable resources such as the **U.S. ME/CFS Clinician Coalition’s primer**, the **Dysautonomia International POTS handbook**, and the **EDS Society’s patient toolkit**. These often contain practical tips (for example, compression gear recommendations, salt recipes, headache management tricks) and can reinforce what is discussed in clinic. Connecting the patient with **support groups** (local if available, or online communities on platforms like Facebook or Slack) for people with hEDS/POTS/MCAS can be invaluable – peers can share what combinations of treatments helped them and recommend local doctors. However, advise caution with unproven treatments often discussed online; encourage the patient to discuss any new ideas with their medical team. **Mental health support** through chronic illness support groups or therapists who understand chronic pain/fatigue can reduce feelings of isolation. The patient may also benefit from occupational therapy for energy conservation techniques and assistive devices (for example, a shower chair, wheelchair for distance if POTS is severe – using these tools as needed is part of pacing). In terms of educational material, the **Institute of Functional Medicine** sometimes has integrative approaches to these syndromes that align with GASLIT-AF (addressing gut health, nutrition, detoxification, etc.), which could complement standard care. If the patient is interested, an integrative medicine consult could synthesize some of these lifestyle and supplement strategies under professional guidance. Lastly, emphasize that this plan is iterative – regular follow-ups to monitor progress in each domain (autonomic, allergic, pain, fatigue) will allow the team to tweak therapies. With patience and a broad-minded approach, many patients with overlapping ME/CFS, POTS, hEDS, MCAS, and fibromyalgia **do improve** over time ([Overlapping conditions in Long COVID at a multisite academic center](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1482917/pdf#:~:text=with%20LC%20may%20find%20symptom,Other)) ([Overlapping conditions in Long COVID at a multisite academic center](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1482917/pdf#:~:text=be%C2%A0harnessed%20for%20LC%20%28149%29,may%20be%C2%A0%20secondary%20to%20neuroimmune)). By following the GASLIT-AF model’s leads – Genetic predispositions, Autonomic stabilization, Structural support, and addressing Allodynic Fatigue – we are providing a roadmap that is both evidence-based and tailored to the patient’s unique syndrome. This comprehensive, prioritized action plan offers hope for better function and quality of life.

This multi-pronged plan aligns with the GASLIT-AF framework and is designed to be actionable in standard clinical settings while also incorporating innovative therapies and referrals when appropriate.
